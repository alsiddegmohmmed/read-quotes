"I’m sure if you were honest with yourself, you’d say you’re exhausted from trying to chase the idea of love.

"But poor relationships over the years may have buried who you are under layers of insecurities, false beliefs, and criticism. You might feel that, in this exact moment, you can’t remember who you were before other people hurt you, which may be as far back as your childhood. But I’m here to say, your true self is still deep inside you, and it’s most likely evolved over the years. Only you can uncover and bring those parts of yourself back to light. Sure, you may have collected a few scars along the way that are also part of who you are today, but don’t worry; there’s not a single person in this world who doesn’t have several scars of their own.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

"The people who are out in the world, leading a positive life filled with their passions, won’t be attracted to others who aren’t doing the same. And, on the flip side, when you’re unhappy, you’re more likely to attract other unhappy people into your life.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"Pursuing interests, activities, and people who make you feel full, rather than drain you, radiates loving energy into your life. You start to enjoy the way you spend your downtime. You might realize working eight hours a day at a job you don’t like isn’t for you. You invest your time into people who care about and cherish your presence. Living a life like this, in turn, makes you someone who people want to be around because you’re radiating the love everyone craves more of in their life.

Don’t hang out with people who make you feel bad,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"Letting go of friendships can be one of the hardest things to do. When you’ve known someone for a long time, you might feel obligated to keep them in your life. But the reality is, not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. People come and go. You need to look out for your mental health first.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

People tend to make themselves smaller when they don’t feel confident. It’s a way of protecting themselves from any emotional harm they’re scared might happen.,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"But studies have shown that having an open, inviting body posture increases a person’s confidence. Standing tall, with your shoulders back and a smile on your face will make you feel like you’re more in control of situations. Of course, do what feels natural but be aware that we often use body language as a way for our insecurities to be expressed.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
Stop comparing yourself to others,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

"Vulnerability starts with being vulnerable with yourself. How can you step into a life of courage if you’re afraid to acknowledge all of you? The memories that hurt, the parts you’re not proud of, your faults, your insecurities. Until you’re able to look in the mirror and confront everything, you won’t be able to experience true vulnerability with others.”<BR>",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

Healthy relationships are between two people who can fix issues and grow together; not people who get along perfectly.,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"You always hear people say, “nothing great comes easy,” and the same goes for love: it’ll be hard sometimes. You should feel respected and cherished, but love means compromising on whose family you spend Christmas with. It means arguments and talking about difficult feelings, like how you spend your money. It’s admitting you’re wrong and also learning to forgive when your partner accidentally hurts you. Love is something you work on, and the reward is wholly worth it; having a person to enjoy the smallest moments in life is worth the work.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"“There will come a time in your life where you need to question the beliefs you unconsciously picked up throughout life if you want to grow. You’ll have to decide whether or not they serve you anymore based on where you want to be with your life. Because everyone is given beliefs about how to live, but that doesn’t mean you need to keep them, especially when they’re holding you back.”",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

You’re the last person to hear about a major life event<BR><BR><BR>Has the person you’re dating ever casually mentioned something major like moving into a new apartment or receiving a promotion? Did it feel more accidental than on purpose? Does that happen a lot?<BR><BR>It’s because they don’t see you as someone who they want to tell important news to.,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"You chose who you prioritize most in life. That’s what the person you’re dating does, too. If you’re finding out about major life events way down the road, it’s a sign that you’re not very important to them.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"Love is respecting your partner’s life even when you’re not involved. It’s knowing you’re both individuals with differences that are respected. You don’t belong to each other; instead, you choose to be with each other. And this free will in love is part of what makes it beautiful.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"“When the time comes, don’t be scared that you’ll say too much or show too many feelings. The right person will meet you with gentleness; they’ll be kind with your vulnerability because they’ll understand that those tender parts of your past created the person they love today.”",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
Every person has their own pain that shaped who they are today. But what defines you as a person is how you move forward with that pain.,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
What kind of person are they? Do they lie to their friends? Are they close to their family? Have they cheated in the past (that you know of)? How is their relationship with their mom/sisters? Do they seem like a genuinely good person?,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"“You can’t hand your happiness and growth over to someone else; those are lifetime investments that only you can make. Other people can support and encourage you along the way, but the work must be done by you.”",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

What you don’t want in a relationship,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
“Let your reaction to their inaction guide you into understanding more about yourself. Ask why you’re willing to invest energy into someone who invests so little of theirs into you. Ask yourself what belief you hold that makes you think you don’t deserve better.”,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

Tips for Changing Your Dating Patterns:<BR>,What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"<BR>Don’t play games. A relationship is like a house: you want to build on a solid foundation. Don’t begin a relationship with someone who waits to text you back or goes silent for days. This isn’t checkers, it’s your love life.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor

"As much as I didn’t want to admit that I needed to work on my own communication skills, doing so helped our relationship. And learning how to argue better helps me maintain my sense of peace and happiness",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"Couples who argue hash out issues rather than bottling them up. They learn more about each other and create healthy compromises. But most importantly, they care enough about the relationship to have conversations that are uncomfortable.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"There’s nothing wrong with needing time to collect yourself, breathe, and think about things. But if you don’t voice that need to your partner, it’s unfair to them. When you suddenly walk away from your partner and ignore them, it’s disrespectful and confusing to them.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
"If you know you’re the type of person who needs to cool down, simply say to your partner, “I’m feeling very upset about this argument. Can we revisit this conversation later today at dinner?” That way you’ve voiced what you’re experiencing and acknowledged you’ll talk about things at another time.",What I Wish I Knew About Love,Kirstie Taylor
