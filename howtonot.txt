Romanticizers believe that love is something that happens to you, and that the reason they’re single is they just haven’t met the right person yet.

When it comes to romantic relationships, psychologist Renae Franiuk found that people have either a soul mate mindset, the belief that relationship satisfaction comes from finding the right person; or a work-it-out mindset, the belief that relationship success derives from putting in effort.

Since Romanticizers are confident they know what their future partner will look like, when they meet someone who doesn’t match that image, they won’t give that person a chance. They end up missing out on great potential matches.

those with the work-it-out mindset believe that relationships take effort, that love is an action you take, not something that happens to you. People with the work-it-out mindset tend to fare better in relationships because when they stumble, they put in the work needed to get the relationship back on track, rather than giving up.<BR>

Great relationships are built, not discovered. A lasting relationship doesn’t just happen. It is the culmination of a series of decisions, including when to get out there, whom to date, how to end it with the wrong person, when to settle down with the right one, and everything in between. Make good decisions, and you propel yourself toward a great love story. Make bad ones, and you veer off course, doomed to repeat the same harmful patterns over and over.<BR>

Finding someone can be hard, but often the real challenge comes later. The hard part is the daily work you put in to grow and sustain a great relationship. The hard part is feeling excited to see your spouse at the end of the day, after thirty years and two kids, long after the honeymoon period is over. The hard part is remembering why you love someone during all the logistical, financial, emotional, and spiritual challenges life throws at you.

Our mindset matters! The ability to shift your mindset from soul mate to work-it-out beliefs could mean the difference between finding a life partner or not.

You can learn to date like a Satisficer by studying the decision-making riddle known as the Secretary Problem. Imagine you are hiring a secretary. And let’s be sure to make him a male secretary, because I know you were envisioning a woman and #fuckthepatriarchy. There are a hundred possible candidates whom you must interview one by one. After each interview, you decide whether to hire that person or keep looking. If you reject a person, he’s gone. You can’t change your mind later and hire him.<BR><BR>How should you maximize your chances of picking the best candidate? You don’t want to decide too early in the process, because you might miss out on a strong candidate at the end of the line. But you don’t want to make it too far without choosing, because what if the final options aren’t very good? It turns out there’s a mathematically correct answer to this problem. You should interview 37 percent of the candidates and then pause. Identify the best person from this first group. Now you have a meaningful benchmark. After evaluating the first 37 percent, you should be prepared to hire the first candidate who is better than the standout from the first group.

Instead of thinking about the total number of people you might date, consider how long you’re likely to actively look for a partner. Apply the rule of 37 percent to that time period. In the book Algorithms to Live By, authors Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths discuss a single man who wants to get married. “Assuming that his search would run from ages eighteen to forty, the 37% rule gave age 26.1 as the point at which to switch from looking to leaping.”<BR><BR>That means that by the age of 26.1, he should set a meaningful benchmark from his first 8.1 years of dating—that is, the single best person he’s dated thus far. He should then marry the next person he meets whom he likes more than that benchmark.

Now it’s your turn. To determine your dating window, count the number of years from when you started dating to when you’d like to enter a long-term relationship. Now, what’s 37 percent of that number? Add that to the age when you started dating. That’s your 37 percent mark. If you’re in your thirties, you’ve probably already passed it. Complete the assignment I gave Doug to determine your benchmark partner.

Don’t worry. I’m not telling you to marry the next person you go out with, nor am I implying that it’s too late if you’re past the 37 percent mark. I’m merely suggesting that you likely already have enough data to generate a reasonable, well-informed benchmark. You do not need more research. The next time you meet someone whom you like as much or more than that benchmark, commit to them.

Maximizers obsess over making the right decision. They want to explore every possible option before they make a choice. Even when they decide, they constantly wonder what they’re missing out on.

For Hesitaters, there’s a story in your head that one day you’ll wake up and feel ready. That story is fiction. That’s not how life works. Everyone feels awkward sometimes. Most people feel nervous in high-pressure situations. Many of us have a part of ourselves we don’t want to reveal to others. And yet these very same people still go out on dates and kiss people and fall in love and break up and fall in love again and get married. Eventually, you just have to get out there and start dating, imperfect as you are. Everyone else is imperfect, too—even the person you’ll end up with.

Hesitaters who delay getting out there also miss the opportunity to improve their dating skills. I’m constantly surprised by how many of my clients think they should naturally know how to date. Dating is hard! And it takes time to master, just like anything else.

It’s the same with dating. You need to practice asking interesting questions, expressing yourself in a compelling way, and going in for a first kiss. Those are your reps. And you can’t work on any of these skills if you’re sitting around by yourself, “preparing.” The only way to get better at it is to actually date.

People with a secure attachment style make ideal partners. They’re reliable and trustworthy. They tend to avoid drama and, if not, are able to defuse it when they see it coming. They’re flexible, forgiving, and good at communicating. They behave consistently. They create healthy boundaries. They’re comfortable with intimacy. People with secure-attachment styles end up reporting higher levels of relationship satisfaction than avoidant or anxious folks.”

You may be anxiously attached if you crave closeness but are insecure about your relationship’s future and your partner’s interest in you. You may be avoidantly attached if you feel uncomfortable when things get too close, and you value freedom over connection. You may be secure if you are comfortable with intimacy, spending time alone, and don’t often worry about the relationship.

Attachment theory is a popular framework for understanding relationships. It can help explain why you’re attracted to certain people, why past relationships haven’t worked out, and why you’re trapped in a pattern of bad habits.

the difference between a love story and a life story. There are many people with whom you can share a tryst but far fewer with whom you can build a life. When you’re thinking about who to marry, she says, don’t ask yourself: What would a love story with this person look like? Instead, ask: Can I make a life with this person? That’s the fundamental distinction.

When we make a decision, we tend to focus on the immediate joy or misery it will bring. But remember: We are bad fortune-tellers! We often can’t account for how those feelings will change over time. Money matters, but only up to a certain extent. You’re not wrong for considering that element of your future relationship, but don’t prioritize wealth above all else.

Lust is incredibly intense in the beginning and then fades. When we fall in love, it feels like we’re addicted to the other person, as if they’re a drug. Fisher found that cocaine and falling in love light up the same regions of the brain.

<BR>Finally, remember what we just learned about adaptation. Even if you marry the most attractive person, eventually, you’ll get used to how they look. That initial pleasure will fade. A big part of our sex drive is associated with novelty. So no matter how hot your partner is, it’s likely that your sexual interest in them will decrease over time, simply because they are no longer new to you. To paraphrase some Internet wisdom: “For every hot person, there is someone out there tired of having sex with them.”

When we’re older and thinking about long-term relationships and, eventually, marriage, the process is more like a merger: two complete beings coming together. The older we get, the more set in our ways we are, and the more we crave someone who will easily fit into our lives. We assume that the more similar we are, the easier the merger will be.<BR>

<BR>I sat him down and told him that two of him would be too much for one room, let alone one relationship! They’d fight to be the center of attention. “Do you know the show The Amazing Race?” I asked him. The show follows couples or pairs of friends or family members who travel to exotic locations to complete missions. “The pairs that are too similar fight,” I said. “They get stuck on the same things. The most successful duos complement each other. They don’t have identical traits. When they miss a flight, one partner finds another route and soothes the other’s panic. That’s what makes them win. You want the same thing with your life partner.”

Here’s the key: It’s fine to have different interests, so long as the time you spend pursuing your favorite activities doesn’t preclude you from investing in the relationship. If you love wine and your partner couldn’t care less about it, that’s okay; you don’t need to marry a sommelier. What matters is that when you drink wine, or go on a trip to Napa to try a new prized cabernet sauvignon, your partner doesn’t try to make you feel guilty or say something like “Why do you always have to drink?” A good relationship has space for different people with different hobbies.

Consider what roles you’ve asked your partner to play that they are uninterested in fulfilling: for example, insisting they go to a party with you when they much prefer smaller gatherings. Or wishing your partner would suggest visits to museums and art galleries when it’s just not their thing. Remember, just because they don’t share all your interests doesn’t make them a bad partner! And for those roles your partner isn’t suited for, find a friend or family member who can fill in. In the long run, this will make you happier because your needs are being met. And it will make your partner happier because they can focus on roles that match their skills and interests.

Kind partners are awesome. They’re generous, they’re empathic, and they want to be supportive of you.” Kindness and emotional stability also allow us to treat our partner with care and compassion, which research from John and Julie Gottman suggests is the key to long-term relationship success.

One easy way to estimate someone’s loyalty is to see if they have friends from different stages of their lives. How many old friendships have they carried with them over the years? Did they ditch their college bestie when they got depressed, or do they still meet up for monthly movie matinees? Do people from their past seem to rely on them for companionship and support?

You want to align yourself with someone who has a growth mindset because when problems arise, which they inevitably will, you’ll want a partner who will rise to the occasion, not throw up their hands in defeat. A person with a growth mindset is much more likely to buckle down and work on improving things rather than give up on the relationship and assume things can’t be fixed.

In the end, a relationship is about what happens when the two of you come together. Focus on the side of you this person brings out, because that’s who you’ll be whenever you’re with them.

The apps show us people who meet our initial criteria—the type of people we think we want. If you believe that you’d hate dating a woman who’s taller than you are, and the apps offer you only short women to choose from, you never get the chance to be proved wrong.

the paradox of choice: We assume that more choice will make us happier, but that’s often not the case. In fact, too many options make us less happy, in part because of choice overload. It can feel so overwhelming to compare our options that we may give up and make no decision at all.<BR>

 I’d designed called the Event Decision Matrix. It helps busy people strategically choose the best events. Every time you hear about a new event, you plot it on the matrix using these two dimensions:<BR><BR>How likely is it that I’ll interact with other people at this event?<BR>How likely is it that I’ll enjoy myself at this event?

You can become a better conversationalist by learning to give support responses rather than shift responses. Sociologist Charles Derber identified a shift response as a moment in which you shift the focus of the conversation back to yourself. A support response, on the other hand, encourages the speaker to continue the story.

That’s because of a phenomenon called the peak-end rule: When assessing an experience, people judge it based largely on how they felt at the most intense moment and at the end. Their memory isn’t an average of their minute-by-minute experiences.

Write yourself a letter about why you’ve chosen to end things. In a few weeks, when you’re horny or lonely (or, in extreme cases, “hornly”) or want someone to feed your rabbit during a trip, you’ll remember exactly why you made this difficult decision.

I really care about you, and I don’t want to hurt you, but I think we need to break up. We both know this relationship hasn’t been working for a while. We tried to make it better, but at this point, I don’t think we can make the changes we need to. I want us to both find love and be happy, but I don’t think this relationship is going to give us that.

If she asks what she did wrong: “This isn’t about anything you did or about who you are. It’s about what we create when we’re together. I don’t feel like this relationship brings out the best side of me. You didn’t do anything wrong, and I don’t want you to blame yourself.”
