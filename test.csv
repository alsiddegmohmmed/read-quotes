▪ a deep, driving desire to learn, a vigorous determination to increase your ability to deal with people.How can you develop such an urge? By constantly reminding yourself how important these principles are to you. Picture to yourself how their mastery will aid you in leading a richer, fuller, happier and more fulfilling life. Say to yourself over and over: ‘My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extent upon my skill in dealing with people.’


▪ the constant application of his homemade system. This is what he does. I’ll put it in his own words as accurately as I can remember. ‘“What mistakes did I make that time?” ‘“What did I do that was right – and in what way could I have improved my performance?” “What lessons can I learn from that experience?”


▪ ‘Under my coat is a weary heart, but a kind one – one that would do nobody any harm.’


▪ I learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.’

▪ an animal rewarded for good behaviour will learn much more rapidly and retain what it learns far more effectively than an animal punished for bad behaviour.


▪ When dealing with people, let us remember we are not dealing with creatures of logic. We are dealing with creatures of emotion, creatures bristling with prejudices and motivated by pride and vanity.





▪ Instead of condemning people, let’s try to understand them. Let’s try to figure out why they do what they do. That’s a lot more profitable and intriguing than criticism; and it breeds sympathy, tolerance and kindness. ‘To know all is to forgive all.’



Don’t criticise, condemn or complain.

▪ THERE IS ONLY one way under high heaven to get anybody to do anything. Did you ever stop to think of that? Yes, just one way. And that is by making the other person want to do it

▪ Dr. Dewey said that the deepest urge in human nature is ‘the desire to be important.’

▪ The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.

▪ ‘I consider my ability to arouse enthusiasm among my people,’ said Schwab, ‘the greatest asset I possess, and the way to develop the best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.

▪ ‘In my wide association in life, meeting with many and great people in various parts of the world,’ Schwab declared, ‘I have yet to find the person, however great or exalted his station, who did not do better work and put forth greater effort under a spirit of approval than he would ever do under a spirit of criticism.’

▪ When a study was made a few years ago on runaway wives, what do you think was discovered to be the main reason wives ran away? It was ‘lack of appreciation.’


▪ The difference between appreciation and flattery? That is simple. One is sincere and the other insincere. One comes from the heart out; the other from the teeth out. One is unselfish; the other selfish.

▪ ‘Don’t be afraid of enemies who attack you. Be afraid of the friends who flatter you.’

▪ ‘Teach me neither to proffer nor receive cheap praise.’

▪ When we are not engaged in thinking about some definite problem, we usually spend about 95 percent of our time thinking about ourselves.

▪ Why talk about what we want? That is childish. Absurd. Of course, you are interested in what you want. You are eternally interested in it. But no one else is. The rest of us are just like you: we are interested in what we want. So the only way on earth to influence other people is to talk about what they want and show them how to get it.



▪ Tomorrow you may want to persuade somebody to do something. Before you speak, pause and ask yourself: ‘How can I make this person want to do it?’

▪ If there is any one secret of success, it lies in the ability to get the other person’s point of view and see things from that person’s angle as well as from your own.’

▪ Mrs. Anderson did not state what she wanted, but wrote in the letter how she could help them, and focused on their wants, not her own.

▪ The world is full of people who are grabbing and self-seeking. So the rare individual who unselfishly tries to serve others has an enormous advantage. He has little competition.

▪ People who can put themselves in the place of other people, who can understand the workings of their minds, need never worry about what the future has in store for them.’

▪ If out of reading this book you get just one thing – an increased tendency to think always in terms of other people’s point of view, and see things from their angle – if you get that one thing out of this book, it may easily prove to be one of the building blocks of your career.

▪ Most people go through college and learn to read Virgil and master the mysteries of calculus without ever discovering how their own minds function.

▪ Professor Overstreet’s wise advice: First, arouse in the other person an eager want. He who can do this has the whole world with him. He who cannot walks a lonely way.

▪ No one with a trace of horse sense would expect a child three years old to react to the viewpoint of a father thirty years old. Yet that was precisely what that father had expected.

▪ You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

▪ If we merely try to impress people and get people interested in us, we will never have many true, sincere friends. Friends, real friends, are not made that way.

▪ Napoleon tried it, and in his last meeting with Josephine he said: ‘Josephine, I have been as fortunate as any man ever was on this earth; and yet, at this hour, you are the only person in the world on whom I can rely.’ And historians doubt whether he could rely even on her.

▪ ‘It is the individual who is not interested in his fellow men who has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It is from among such individuals that all human failures spring.’

▪ I have discovered from personal experience that one can win the attention and time and cooperation of even the most sought-after people by becoming genuinely interested in them.

▪ If we want to make friends, let’s put ourselves out to do things for other people – things that require time, energy, unselfishness and thoughtfulness. If we want to make friends, let’s greet people with animation and enthusiasm.

▪ ‘We are interested in others when they are interested in us.’

▪ A show of interest, as with every other principle of human relations, must be sincere. It must pay off not only for the person showing the interest, but for the person receiving the attention. It is a two-way street – both parties benefit.

▪ If you want others to like you, if you want to develop real friendships, if you want to help others at the same time as you help yourself, keep this principle in mind;



▪ the expression one wears on one’s face is far more important than the clothes one wears on one’s back.

▪ People who smile,’ he said, ‘tend to manage, teach and sell more effectively, and to raise happier children. There’s far more information in a smile than a frown. That’s why encouragement is a much more effective teaching device than punishment.’

▪ suggest that you smile when talking on the phone. Your ‘smile’ comes through in your voice.

▪ You must have a good time meeting people if you expect them to have a good time meeting you.

▪ Act as if you were already happy, and that will tend to make you happy.

▪ Action seems to follow feeling, but really action and feeling go together; and by regulating the action, which is under the more direct control of the will, we can indirectly regulate the feeling, which is not.

▪ if our cheerfulness be lost, is to sit up cheerfully and to act and speak as if cheerfulness were already there . . .’

▪ Everybody in the world is seeking happiness – and there is one sure way to find it. That is by controlling your thoughts. Happiness doesn’t depend on outward conditions. It depends on inner conditions.

▪ Whenever you go out-of-doors, draw the chin in, carry the crown of the head high, and fill the lungs to the utmost; drink in the sunshine; greet your friends with a smile, and put soul into every handclasp.

▪ A man without a smiling face must not open a shop.

▪ Whenever he met a new acquaintance, he found out his or her complete name and some facts about his or her family, business and political opinions. He fixed all these facts well in mind as part of the picture, and the next time he met that person, even if it was a year later, he was able to shake hands, inquire after the family. Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together. Remember that name and call it easily, and you have paid a subtle and very effective compliment. But forget it or misspell it – and you have placed yourself at a sharp disadvantage.

▪ For many centuries, nobles and magnates supported artists, musicians and authors so that their creative works would be dedicated to them.

▪ Most people don’t remember names, for the simple reason that they don’t take the time and energy necessary to concentrate and repeat and fix names indelibly in their minds. They make excuses for themselves; they are too busy.

▪ Franklin D. Roosevelt knew that one of the simplest, most obvious and most important ways of gaining good will was by remembering names and making people feel important – yet how many of us do it? And the ability to remember names is almost as important in business and social contacts as it is in politics . His technique? Simple. If he didn’t hear the name distinctly, he said, ‘So sorry. I didn’t get the name clearly.’ Then, if it was an unusual name, he would say, ‘How is it spelled?’

▪ Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.

▪ I had listened intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. And he felt it. Naturally that pleased him. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments we can pay anyone.

▪ Exclusive attention to the person who is speaking to you is very important. Nothing else is so flattering as that.’

▪ For Roosevelt knew, as all leaders know, that the royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most.

▪ Talking in terms of the other person’s interests pays off for both parties.

▪ There is one all-important law of human conduct. If we obey that law, we shall almost never get into trouble. In fact, that law, if obeyed, will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we shall get into endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important.

▪ Jesus summed it up in one thought – probably the most important rule in the world: ‘Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.’

▪ Little phrases such as ‘I’m sorry to trouble you,’ ‘Would you be so kind as to – ?’ ‘Won’t you please?’ ‘Would you mind?’ ‘Thank you’ – little courtesies like these oil the cogs of the monotonous grind of everyday life – and incidentally, they are the hallmark of good breeding.

▪ Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.’


▪ When two partners always agree, one of them is not necessary.’ If there is some point you haven’t thought about, be thankful if it is brought to your attention. Perhaps this disagreement is your opportunity to be corrected before you make a serious mistake.

▪ The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

▪ If you can be sure of being right only 55 percent of the time, you can go down to Wall Street and make a million dollars a day. If you can’t be sure of being right even 55 percent of the time, why should you tell other people they are wrong? and if you tell them they are wrong, do you make them want to agree with you? Never! For you have struck a direct blow at their intelligence, judgement, pride and self-respect. That will make them want to strike back. But it will never make them want to change their minds.

▪ Never begin by announcing ‘I am going to prove so-and-so to you.’ That’s bad. That’s tantamount to saying: ‘I’m smarter than you are. I’m going to tell you a thing or two and make you change your mind.’ If you are going to prove anything, don’t let anybody know it. Do it so subtly, so adroitly, that no one will feel that you are doing it.

▪ Over three hundred years ago Galileo said: You cannot teach a man anything; you can only help him to find it within himself.

▪ Socrates said repeatedly to his followers in Athens: One thing only I know, and that is that I know nothing.

▪ You will never get into trouble by admitting that you may be wrong. That will stop all argument and inspire your opponent to be just as fair and open and broad-minded as you are. It will make him want to admit that he, too, may be wrong. So, if you are inclined to tell people they are wrong, please read the following paragraph every morning before breakfast. It is from James Harvey Robinson’s enlightening book The Mind in the Making. I have found it of enormous value when I can permit myself to understand the other person. The way in which I have worded this statement may seem strange to you. Is it necessary to permit oneself to understand another? I think it is. Our first reaction to most of the statements (which we hear from other people) is an evaluation or judgment, rather than an understanding of it. When someone expresses some feeling, attitude or belief, our tendency is almost immediately to feel ‘that’s right,’ or ‘that’s stupid,’ ‘that’s abnormal,’ ‘that’s unreasonable,’ ‘that’s incorrect,’ ‘that’s not nice.’ Very rarely do we permit ourselves to understand precisely what the meaning of the statement is to the other person.

▪ When we are wrong, we may admit it to ourselves. And if we are handled gently and tactfully, we may admit it to others and even take pride in our frankness and broad-mindedness.

▪ ‘I am convinced now that nothing good is accomplished and a lot of damage can be done if you tell a person straight out that he or she is wrong. You only succeed in stripping that person of self-dignity and making yourself an unwelcome part of any discussion.’

▪ In other words, don’t argue with your customer or your spouse or your adversary. Don’t tell them they are wrong, don’t get them stirred up. Use a little diplomacy.

▪ Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re wrong.’

￼

▪ If we know we are going to be rebuked anyhow, isn’t it far better to beat the other person to it and do it ourselves?

▪ Say about yourself all the derogatory things you know the other person is thinking or wants to say or intends to say – and say them before that person has a chance to say them. The chances are a hundred to one that a generous, forgiving attitude will be taken and your mistakes will be minimised just as the mounted policeman did with me and Rex.

▪ Any fool can try to defend his or her mistakes – and most fools do – but it raises one above the herd and gives one a feeling of nobility and exultation to admit one’s mistakes.

▪ When we are right, let’s try to win people gently and tactfully to our way of thinking, and when we are wrong – and that will be surprisingly often, if we are honest with ourselves – let’s admit our mistakes quickly and with enthusiasm.

▪ but if you come to me and say, “Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the points at issue are,” we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candour and the desire to get together, we will get together.’

▪ Scolding parents and domineering bosses and husbands and nagging wives ought to realize that people don’t want to change their minds. They can’t be forced or driven to agree with you or me. But they may possibly be led to, if we are gentle and friendly, ever so gentle and ever so friendly.

▪ It is an old and true maxim that ‘a drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.’ So with men, if you would win a man to your cause, first convince him that you are his sincere friend. Therein is a drop of honey that catches his heart; which, say what you will, is the great high road to his reason.

▪ IN TALKING WITH people, don’t begin by discussing the things on which you differ. Begin by emphasising – and keep on emphasising – the things on which you agree. Keep emphasising, if possible, that you are both striving for the same end and that your only difference is one of method and not of purpose.

▪ I finally learned that it doesn’t pay to argue, that it is much more profitable and much more interesting to look at things from the other person’s viewpoint and try to get that person saying “yes, yes.”’

▪ The next time we are tempted to tell someone he or she is wrong, let’s remember old Socrates and ask a gentle question – a question that will get the ‘yes, yes’ response.

▪ If you disagree with them you may be tempted to interrupt. But don’t. It is dangerous. They won’t pay attention to you while they still have a lot of ideas of their own crying for expression. So listen patiently and with an open mind. Be sincere about it. Encourage them to express their ideas fully.

▪ Even our friends would much rather talk to us about their achievements than listen to us boast about ours.

▪ La Rochefoucauld, the French philosopher, said: ‘If you want enemies, excel your friends; but if you want friends, let your friends excel you.’

▪ Why is that true? Because when our friends excel us, they feel important; but when we excel them, they – or at least some of them – will feel inferior and envious.

▪ PRINCIPLE 6

Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

￼

▪ PRINCIPLE 7

Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

▪ REMEMBER THAT OTHER people may be totally wrong. But they don’t think so. Don’t condemn them. Any fool can do that. Try to understand them. Only wise, tolerant, exceptional people even try to do that.

▪ There is a reason why the other man thinks and acts as he does. Ferret out that reason – and you have the key to his actions, perhaps to his personality.

▪ If you say to yourself, ‘How would I feel, how would I react if I were in his shoes?’ you will save yourself time and irritation, for ‘by becoming interested in the cause, we are less likely to dislike the effect.’ And, in addition, you will sharply increase your skill in human relationships.

▪ I would rather walk the sidewalk in front of a person’s office for two hours before an interview than step into that office without a perfectly clear idea of what I was going to say and what that person – from my knowledge of his or her interests and motives – was likely to answer.

▪ If, as a result of reading this book, you get only one thing – an increased tendency to think always in terms of the other person’s point of view, and see things from that person’s angle, as well as your own – if you get only one thing from this book, it may easily prove to be one of the stepping-stones of your career.

▪ PRINCIPLE 8

Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.

▪ You deserve very little credit for being what you are – and remember, the people who come to you irritated, bigoted, unreasoning, deserve very little discredit for being what they are. Feel sorry for the poor devils. Pity them. Sympathise with them. Say to yourself: ‘There, but for the grace of God, go I.’

▪ ‘Sympathy the human species universally craves. The child eagerly displays his injury; or even inflicts a cut or bruise in order to reap abundant sympathy. For the same purpose adults . . . show their bruises, relate their accidents, illness, especially details of surgical operations. “Self-pity” for misfortunes real or imaginary is, in some measure, practically a universal practice.’

▪ PRINCIPLE 9

Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.

▪ J. Pierpont Morgan observed, in one of his analytical interludes, that a person usually has two reasons for doing a thing: one that sounds good and a real one.

▪ PRINCIPLE 10

Appeal to the nobler motives.

▪ This is the day of dramatisation. Merely stating a truth isn’t enough. The truth has to be made vivid, interesting, dramatic. You have to use showmanship. The movies do it. Television does it. And you will have to do it if you want attention.

▪ PRINCIPLE 11

Dramatise your ideas.

▪ IN A NUTSHELL

WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING

PRINCIPLE 1

The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

PRINCIPLE 2

Show respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say, ‘You’re wrong.’

PRINCIPLE 3

If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.

PRINCIPLE 4

Begin in a friendly way.

PRINCIPLE 5

Get the other person saying ‘yes, yes’ immediately.

PRINCIPLE 6

Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.

PRINCIPLE 7

Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.

PRINCIPLE 8

Try honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.

PRINCIPLE 9

Be sympathetic with the other person’s ideas and desires.

PRINCIPLE 10

Appeal to the nobler motives.

PRINCIPLE 11

Dramatise your ideas.

PRINCIPLE 12

Throw down a challenge.

▪ It is always easier to listen to unpleasant things after we have heard some praise of our good points.

▪ PRINCIPLE 1

Begin with praise and honest appreciation.

▪ Many people begin their criticism with sincere praise followed by the word ‘but’ and ending with a critical statement. For example, in trying to change a child’s careless attitude toward studies, we might say, ‘We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term. But if you had worked harder on your algebra, the results would have been better.’

In this case, Johnnie might feel encouraged until he heard the word ‘but.’ He might then question the sincerity of the original praise. To him, the praise seemed only to be a contrived lead-in to a critical inference of failure. Credibility would be strained, and we probably would not achieve our objectives of changing Johnnie’s attitude toward his studies.

▪ This could be easily overcome by changing the word ‘but’ to ‘and.’ ‘We’re really proud of you, Johnnie, for raising your grades this term, and by continuing the same conscientious efforts next term, your algebra grade can be up with all the others.’

▪ Calling attention to one’s mistakes indirectly works wonders with sensitive people who may resent bitterly any direct criticism

▪ PRINCIPLE 2

Call attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.

▪ PRINCIPLE 3

Talk about your own mistakes before criticising the other person.

▪ He would say, ‘You might consider this,’ or ‘Do you think that would work?’ Frequently he would say, after he had dictated a letter, ‘What do you think of this?’ In looking over a letter of one of his assistants, he would say, ‘Maybe if we were to phrase it this way it would be better.’ He always gave people the opportunity to do things themselves; he never told his assistants to do things; he let them do them, let them learn from their mistakes.

▪ Asking questions not only makes an order more palatable; it often stimulates the creativity of the persons whom you ask. People are more likely to accept an order if they have had a part in the decision that caused the order to be issued.

▪ PRINCIPLE 4

Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.

▪ Letting

▪ Even if we are right and the other person is definitely wrong, we only destroy ego by causing someone to lose face. The legendary French aviation pioneer and author Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote: ‘I have no right to say or do anything that diminishes a man in his own eyes. What matters is not what I think of him, but what he thinks of himself. Hurting a man in his dignity is a crime.’

▪ PRINCIPLE 5

Let the other person save face.

▪ Let us praise even the slightest improvement. That inspires the other person to keep on improving.

▪ Use of praise instead of criticism is the basic concept of B.F. Skinner’s teachings. This great contemporary psychologist has shown by experiments with animals and with humans that when criticism is minimised and praise emphasised, the good things people do will be reinforced and the poorer things will atrophy for lack of attention.

▪ The children were doing far more right things than wrong ones.’ All of this was a result of praising the slightest improvement in the children rather than condemning everything they did wrong.

▪ What Mr. Roper did was not just flatter the young printer and say ‘You’re good.’ He specifically pointed out how his work was superior. Because he had singled out a specific accomplishment, rather than just making general flattering remarks, his praise became much more meaningful to the person to whom it was given. Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.

▪ Everybody likes to be praised, but when praise is specific, it comes across as sincere – not something the other person may be saying just to make one feel good.

▪ Let me repeat: The principles taught in this book will work only when they come from the heart. I am not advocating a bag of tricks. I am talking about a new way of life.

▪ Talking about changing people. If you and I will inspire the people with whom we come in contact to a realisation of the hidden treasures they possess, we can do far more than change people. We can literally transform them.

▪ Compared with what we ought to be, we are only half awake. We are making use of only a small part of our physical and mental resources. Stating the thing broadly, the human individual thus lives far within his limits. He possesses powers of various sorts which he habitually fails to use.

▪ Yes, you who are reading these lines possess powers of various sorts which you habitually fail to use; and one of these powers you are probably not using to the fullest extent is your magic ability to praise people and inspire them with a realisation of their latent possibilities.

▪ Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be ‘hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.’

▪ In short, if you want to improve a person in a certain respect, act as though that particular trait were already one of his or her outstanding characteristics. Shakespeare said ‘Assume a virtue, if you have it not.’ And it might be well to assume and state openly that other people have the virtue you want them to develop. Give them a fine reputation to live up to, and they will make prodigious efforts rather than see you disillusioned.

▪ PRINCIPLE 7

Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.

▪ Tell your child, your spouse, or your employee that he or she is stupid or dumb at a certain thing, has no gift for it, and is doing it all wrong, and you have destroyed almost every incentive to try to improve. But use the opposite technique – be liberal with your encouragement, make the thing seem easy to do, let the other person know that you have faith in his ability to do it, that he has an undeveloped flair for it – and he will practise until the dawn comes in the window in order to excel.

▪ PRINCIPLE 8

Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.

￼

▪ Always make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

▪ PRINCIPLE 9

Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.

▪ The first key to ridding yourself of limiting subconscious beliefs is to become aware of them.

▪ The Law of Attraction, the basic idea is: Focus on that which makes you feel good and ye shall find (attract) that which makes you feel good.

▪ We’re all attracting energy to ourselves all the time whether we realize it or not.

▪ And when we’re vibrating at a low frequency (feeling pessimistic, needy, victimized, jealous, shameful, worried, convinced we are ugly) yet expect high frequency, awesome things and experiences to come into our lives, we are often disappointed.

▪ You need to raise your frequency to match the vibration of the one you want to tune into.

▪ When you learn to consciously master the energetic realm, believe in the not yet seen, and stay in your highest frequency, you harness your innate power to create the reality you desire.

▪ This is about believing, even when things are at their most uncertain or absolute crappiest, that there is a bright shiny flipside within your reach.

▪ “One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time.”

▪ If you are depressed, you are living in the past. If you are anxious, you are living in the future. If you are at peace, you are living in the present.

▪ The more time you spend in the moment, the richer your life will be. Being present gets you out of your head and connects you to Source Energy, which raises your frequency, which attracts things of like frequency to you.

▪ Wanting to be someone else is a waste of the person you are.

▪ In the self-help/spiritual community, “Ego” is used to refer to the shadow self, or the false self, or the self that’s acting like a weenie.

▪ Oftentimes, taking great leaps of faith is labeled as irresponsible or selfish or insane (until you succeed of course, then you’re brilliant). This is because:

Watching someone else totally go for it can be incredibly upsetting to the person who’s spent a lifetime building a solid case for why they themselves can’t.

▪ one of the first things you might have to deal with when you decide to wake up from the Big Snooze and make massive positive changes in your life is disapproval from other people who are snoring away. Especially the people closest to you, lame as this may sound.

▪ When taking great leaps forward, life often turns to shit before it turns to Shinola.

▪ We torture ourselves incessantly, and for what purpose? If we can glimpse the glory (and I know you can), why do we waste our precious time giving any energy to the other options? Wouldn’t life be so much more fun, productive, and sexy if we fully embraced our magnificently delightful selves?

▪ Have you ever noticed how when someone you admire goes out and does something phenomenal, you’re happy for her or him, but you’re not surprised—of course they did something phenomenal, they’re a phenomenal person!

▪ try seeing yourself through the eyes of someone who admires you.

▪ You get to choose how you perceive your reality. So why, when it comes to perceiving yourself, would you choose to see anything other than a super huge rock star of a creature?

▪ You’re on a journey with no defined beginning, middle or end. There are no wrong twists and turns. There is just being. And your job is to be as you as you can be. This is why you’re here. To shy away from who you truly are would leave the world you-less. You are the only you there is and ever will be. I repeat, you are the only you there is and ever will be. Do not deny the world its one and only chance to bask in your brilliance.

▪ We are all perfect in our own, magnificent, fucked-up ways. Laugh at yourself. Love yourself and others. Rejoice in the cosmic ridiculousness.

▪ If we really love ourselves, everything in our life works.

▪ We’re born knowing how to trust our instincts, how to breathe deeply, how to eat only when we’re hungry, how to not care about what anyone thinks of oursinging voices, dance moves, or hairdos, we know how to play, create, and love without holding back

▪ Then, as we grow and learn from the people around us, we replace many of these primal understandings with negative false beliefs, fear, shame, and self-doubt.

▪ And while there are countless ways that we rip ourselves off, there’s one way in particular that is, without a doubt, the most rampant and the most devastating of all: we invest everything we’ve got in believing that we’re not good enough.

▪ When we’re happy and all in love with ourselves, we can’t be bothered with the bullshit (our own or other people’s).

▪ some of the best ways to win yourself over again:

1. APPRECIATE HOW SPECIAL YOU ARE

▪ 2. DROWN YOURSELF IN AFFIRMATIONS

▪ if you want to turn the ship around, you need to rewire your brain and train it to think differently. And this is what affirmations can do for you.

▪ Figure out which affirmations you need to hear the most and repeat them all day long in your head,

▪ Write down your favorite affirmations ten times every morning and ten times every night before you go to bed and say them out loud.

▪ And yes, at the beginning it may feel like you’re lying to yourself, but the truth is, you’re living the lie, so the affirmations get you back to truth.

▪ 3. DO THINGS YOU LOVE

▪ Look at your life and see where you’re letting yourself down. If you hear yourself saying things like “I love going out to see live music! I can’t remember the last time I did it,” make time.

▪ if you’re the kind of person who puts everyone else’s needs first, start putting yours up front.

▪ you aren’t a selfish person for taking care of yourself, just a happier one. Take care of yourself as if you’re the most awesome person you’ve ever met.

▪ For example, if every time you look in the mirror, your first thought is yikes, make a conscious effort to change it to hi, gorgeous!

▪ If your standard response to screwing something up is ugh, Her Royal Clumsiness strikes again, replace it with what can I learn from this?

▪ Do not spend your life clinging to the insulting decisions you’ve made about yourself. Instead, make the conscious choice to replace them with new and improved ones.

▪ 5. DITCH THE SELF-DEPRECATING HUMOR

▪ What you tell yourself on a daily basis is more powerful than you know. Seemingly harmless jokes, over time, turn into seriously destructive beliefs.

▪ Our thoughts become our words, our words become our beliefs, our beliefs become our actions, our actions become our habits, and our habits become our realities.

▪ 6. LET THE LOVE IN

▪ Receive compliments gracefully instead of countering with a disclaimer such as, “Oh, this ratty old thing?” Try this instead: “Thank you.” Period.

▪ The better our bodies feel, the happier and more productive we are.

▪ 7. DON’T COMPARE YOURSELF TO OTHERS

▪ 8. FORGIVE YOURSELF

▪ Get clear on this one truth: guilt, shame, and self-criticism are some of the most destructive forces in your life, which is why forgiving yourself is one of the most powerful.

▪ Think of a specific thing that you did that you feel badly about. Call it up in your mind and feel it in your body. Repeat the following over and over while thinking of it and really feel what you’re saying to yourself:

▪ Holding on to my bad feelings about this is doing nothing but harming me, and everyone else, and preventing me from enjoying my life fully. I am an awesome person. I choose to enjoy my life. I choose to let this go.

▪ DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME GIVING ONE SINGLE CRAP ABOUT WHAT ANYBODY ELSE THINKS OF YOU.

▪ Other people’s opinions motivate every move we make in our teens and our twenties. And, as we age, if we’re moving in the right direction, our obsession with how we’re perceived by others begins to trickle away

▪ the only questions you ever need to consider when making decisions about your life are:

1. Is this something I want to be, do, or have?

2. Is this going to take me in the direction I want to go (not should go)?

3. Is this going to screw over* anybody else in the process?

▪ You are responsible for what you say and do. You are not responsible for whether or not people freak out about it.

▪ Two people can walk out of the same movie, one person clinging to the walls, bloodshot and devastated, leaving a trail of tissues, more moved by this film than any other film in the history of cinema while the other person goes marching up to the ticket counter and demands her money back because she thought it was the worst piece of garbage to ever be projected onto a screen.

▪ What other people think about you has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them.

▪ if you find yourself always seeking outside approval that you’re good enough or cool enough or talented enough or worthy enough, you’re screwed.

▪ if you base your self-worth on what everyone else thinks of you, you hand all your power over to other people and become dependent on a source outside of yourself for validation.

▪ So how can you truly not care what other people think and be your most powerful Self?

▪ 1. ASK YOURSELF WHY

Why are you about to say or do something? Is it to be liked? To put someone down because you feel insecure?

▪ Practice coming from a place of integrity and you will be victorious.

▪ 2. ALWAYS DO YOUR BEST

▪ if you do the absolute best you possibly can, and come from a place of integrity, then you can be proud of yourself and not give a damn what anyone else thinks.

▪ trust that you know what’s best for you.

▪ 4. FIND A TEMPORARY ROLE MODEL

▪ Find a mentor or a hero or a role model. Get clear on why this person is impressive and inspiring to you, and when faced with a challenge that leaves you guessing how to react, ask yourself, What would my hero do?

▪ Read magazines that interest you, talk to as many people as you can, hang out in places where people who share your interests hang out. Put yourself out there and you never know what you might learn that will inform your next move, or whom you might meet that will present you with your next opportunity.

▪ Follow what feels good in the moment, every moment, and it will lead you through a most excellent life.

▪ LISTEN TO YOUR INTUITION

▪ One of the best ways to do this is to spend five minutes of quiet, by yourself, every day.

▪ When you sit quietly and ask, you get an answer. Eventually. Stick with it, be patient and wait to hear from your inner guidance. You have all the answers you need, you just need to give them the chance to get through to you.

▪ It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.

▪ Try meditating for five to ten minutes each day at first and add on time as you get less squirmy.

▪ There’s no right way or wrong way to do this, no set amount of time, no correct things to feel, no rules about how you have to sit or where you have to do it. All that matters is that you do it if you want to massively improve your life.

▪ You have to change your thinking first, and then the evidence appears.

▪ Keep your thoughts directed at your goal, do everything that you DO know how to do to make it happen, decide with unwavering determination that it will happen, and be on the lookout for the opportunity.

▪ Here are some tried-and-true ways to show your brain who’s driving the bus:

▪ ASK AND IT IS GIVEN

Get quiet, get in The Zone, and get in touch with Source Energy. Clear out the chatter in your brain and create a clean, uncluttered space to impress the thoughts of what you want into the giant thinking substance that is Source Energy. Ask for what you want, send out a nice, clear message in a nice, clear space and begin the manifestation process.

▪ ACT AS IF

If you want something badly, even if you don’t have any evidence that it’s possible for you to attain, believe it is anyway. Fake it until you make it. Do it in spite of yourself. Act as if.

▪ 3. UPGRADE YOUR ENVIRONMENT

▪ MAKE A VISION BOARD

▪ Cut out pictures of places, people, things, and experiences that you want in your life, paste them onto a board and hang it somewhere where you’ll see it all day long.

▪ SURROUND YOURSELF WITH PEOPLE WHO THINK THE WAY YOU WANT TO THINK

▪ Stay away from people with tiny minds and tiny thoughts and start hanging out with people who see limitless possibility as the reality. Surround yourself with people who act on their big ideas, who take action on making positive change in the world and who see nothing as out of their reach.

▪ Make a conscious choice to do this. And if you don’t know anyone who’s got a big fat mind, go out and make some new friends.

▪ Get out there and find some people who make you feel like you can leap tall buildings in a single bound. Be clear on whom you want to meet and make a concerted effort to go meet them.

▪ the more you give, the more you receive. And vice versa.

▪ Whatever happened, happened. Holding on will not change this fact, it will just keep the negative feelings from the past alive, keep you a prisoner to your pain

▪ Forgiveness is all about taking care of you, not the person you need to forgive. It’s about putting your desire to feel good before your desire to be right. It’s about taking responsibility for your own happiness instead of pretending it’s in somebody else’s hands. It’s about owning your power by giving all your anger, resentment, and hurt the heave-ho.

▪ Now how do you actually let it all go? How do you forgive the stupid bastard?

▪ 1. FIND COMPASSION

Finding compassion for yourself or someone else who did something so so so so awful is like pulling a bullet out of your arm: You may kick and scream and hate it at first, but, in the long run, it’s the only way to start the real healing.

▪ One of the best tricks for doing this is to imagine the person you’re resentful of as a little kid. Think of this little person acting out of fear, doing the best they can to protect themselves and attempting to deal with their own suffering in the only way they know how. People act poorly because they are in pain or confused or both.

▪ 2. ERASE THE OTHER PERSON FROM THE EQUATION

▪ When someone does something awful to you, take that person out of the equation so you can open yourself up to have a more pleasant, and productive, reaction (and life). It’s not about them anyway, it’s about you. If you have nobody to be angry at, it’s hard to be angry. Instead, it opens the incident up for questioning. Why did this happen? How was I involved? Why did I attract this to myself? How can I grow from this?

▪ Do yourself a favor and use irritating situations and people as opportunities for growth, not pain.

▪ 3. DECIDE YOU’D RATHER BE HAPPY THAN RIGHT

▪ 4. LOOK AT IT FROM ALL ANGLES

▪ Talk to strangers, we’re all family on this planet.

▪ Expect, and enjoy, the unexpected.

▪ Find the humor.

▪ Winter Is Coming.

▪ Aegon the Dragon’s ancestors escaped the Doom of Valyria and the chaos and slaughter that followed to settle on Dragonstone, a rocky island in the narrow sea. It was from there that Aegon and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys sailed to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.

▪ Can a man still be brave if he’s afraid?”

“That is the only time a man can be brave,” his father told him

▪ Some old wounds never truly heal, and bleed again at the slightest word.

▪ “Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not. Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.”

▪ “The things I do for love,”

▪ I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.”

▪ “First lesson,” Jon said. “Stick them with the pointy end.”

▪ a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone

▪ He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but “my half brother” since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant.

▪ Let them see that their words can cut you, and you’ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name, take it, make it your own. Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore.”

▪ Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it

▪ A Lannister always paid his debts.

▪ Some secrets are safer kept hidden. Some secrets are too dangerous to share, even with those you love and trust.

▪ Lyanna had only smiled. “Love is sweet, dearest Ned, but it cannot change a man’s nature.”

▪ “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.”

▪ Hear my words, and bear witness to my vow,” they recited, their voices filling the twilit grove. “Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the fire that burns against the cold, the light that brings the dawn, the horn that wakes the sleepers, the shield that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night’s Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.”

▪ “So they will not love,” the old man answered, “for love is the bane of honor, the death of duty.”

▪ We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy.

▪ “A craven can be as brave as any man, when there is nothing to fear. And we all do our duty, when there is no cost to it. How easy it seems then, to walk the path of honor. Yet soon or late in every man’s life comes a day when it is not easy, a day when he must choose.”

▪ My father was Maekar, the First of his Name, and my brother Aegon reigned after him in my stead. My grandfather named me for Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, who was his uncle, or his father, depending on which tale you believe. Aemon, he called me…”

“Aemon…Targaryen!” Jon could scarcely believe it.

“Once,” the old man said. “Once. So you see, Jon, I do know…and knowing, I will not tell you stay or go. You must make that choice yourself, and live with it all the rest of your days. As I have.” His voice fell to a whisper. “As I have…”


▪ “The night is dark and full of terrors.”

▪ “They will garb your brother Robb in silks, satins, and velvets of a hundred different colors, while you live and die in black ringmail. He will wed some beautiful princess and father sons on her. You’ll have no wife, nor will you ever hold a child of your own blood in your arms. Robb will rule, you will serve. Men will call you a crow. Him they’ll call Your Grace. Singers will praise every little thing he does, while your greatest deeds all go unsung. Tell me that none of this troubles you, Jon… and I’ll name you a liar, and know I have the truth of it.”

Jon drew himself up, taut as a bowstring. “And if it did trouble me, what might I do, bastard as I am?”

“What will you do?” Mormont asked. “Bastard as you are?”

“Be troubled,” said Jon, “and keep my vows.”

▪ Power resides where men believe it resides. No more and no less.”

▪ What is dead may never die

▪ “What is dead may never die,” his uncle echoed, “but rises again, harder and stronger. Stand.”

▪ “My handmaids say there are ghosts here.”

“There are ghosts everywhere,” Ser Jorah said softly. “We carry them with us wherever we go.”

▪ When we speak of the morrow nothing is ever certain.
