▪ This is a book about outliers, about men and women who do things that are out of the ordinary.

▪ For almost a generation, psychologists around the world have been engaged in a spirited debate over a question that most of us would consider to have been settled years ago. The question is this: is there such a thing as innate talentThe obvious answer is yes. Not every hockey player born in January ends up playing at the professional level. Only some dothe innately talented ones.

▪ out-li-er \-,l•(-9)r\ noun i: something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body 2: a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others of the sample.

▪ Achievement is talent plus preparation. The problem with this view is that the closer psychologists look at the careers of the gifted, the smaller the role innate talent seems to play and the bigger the role preparation seems to play.

▪ It is those who are successful, in other words, who are most likely to be given the kinds of special opportunities that lead to further success. It's the rich who get the biggest tax breaks. It's the best students who get the best teaching and most attention. And it's the biggest nineand ten-year-olds who get the most coaching and practice. Success is the result of what sociologists like to call “accumulative advantage.” The professional hockey player starts out a little bit better than his peers. And that little difference leads to an opportunity that makes that difference a bit bigger, and that edge in turn leads to another opportunity, which makes the initially small difference bigger stilland on and on until the hockey player is a genuine outlier. But he didn't start out an outlier. He started out just a little bit better.

▪ Everyone from all three groups started playing at roughly the same age, around five years old. In those first few years, everyone practiced roughly the same amount, about two or three hours a week. But when the students were around the age of eight, real differences started to emerge. The students who would end up the best in their class began to practice more than everyone else: six hours a week by age nine, eight hours a week by age twelve, sixteen hours a week by age fourteen, and up and up, until by the age of twenty they were practicingthat is, purposefully and single-mindedly playing their instruments with the intent to get betterwell over thirty hours a week. In fact, by the age of twenty, the elite performers had each totaled ten thousand hours of practice. By contrast, the merely good students had totaled eight thousand hours, and the future music teachers had totaled just over four thousand hours.

▪ Ericsson and his colleagues then compared amateur pianists with professional pianists. The same pattern emerged. The amateurs never practiced more than about three hours a week over the course of their childhood, and by the age of twenty they had totaled two thousand hours of practice. The professionals, on the other hand, steadily increased their practice time every year, until by the age of twenty they, like the violinists, had reached ten thousand hours.

▪ People don't rise from nothing. We do owe something to parentage and patronage.

▪ The striking thing about Ericsson's study is that he and his colleagues couldn't find any “naturals,” musicians who floated effortlessly to the top while practicing a fraction of the time their peers did. Nor could they find any “grinds,” people who worked harder than everyone else, yet just didn't have what it takes to break the top ranks. Their research suggestes that once a musician has enough ability to get into a top music school, the thing that distinguishes one performer from another is how hard he or she works. That's it. And what's more, the people at the very top don't work just harder or even much harder than everyone else. They work much, much harder.

▪ It makes a difference where and when we grew up. The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine. It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.

▪ The idea that excellence at performing a complex task requires a critical minimum level of practice surfaces again and again in studies of expertise. In fact, researchers have settled on what they believe is the magic number for true expertise: ten thousand hours.

▪ The emerging picture from such studies is that ten thousand hours of practice is required to achieve the level of mastery associated with being a world-class expertin anything

▪ Parents with a child born at the end of the calendar year often think about holding their child back before the start of kindergarten: it's hard for a five-year-old to keep up with a child born many months earlier. But most parents, one suspects, think that whatever disadvantage a younger child faces in kindergarten eventually goes away. But it doesn't. It's just like hockey. The small initial advantage that the child born in the early part of the year has over the child born at the end of the year persists. It locks children into patterns of achievement and underachievement, encouragement and discouragement, that stretch on and on for years.

▪ Ten thousand hours is the magic number of greatness.

▪ the people we surround ourselves with have a profound effect on who we are.

▪ he was so tired out that he wished, if only for a moment, to draw a breath in another world

▪ He was so immersed in himself and had isolated himself so much from everyone that he was afraid not only of meeting his landlady but of meeting anyone at all.

▪ I'm working day and night, and for all that I'm not working very much.

▪ A novel is a work of poetry. In order to write it, one must have tranquility of spirit and of impression

▪ It is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go. For there are times when one absolutely must go at least somewhere!

▪ “Do you understand, do you understand, my dear sir, what it means when there is no longer anywhere to go?”

▪ “For it is necessary that every man have at least somewhere to go . . .”

▪ And generally it was painful for him at that moment to think about anything at all. He would have liked to become totally oblivious, oblivious of everything, and then wake up and start totally anew . . .

▪ And then I myself will come to you to be crucified, for I thirst not for joy, but for sorrow and tears!


▪ “Absolutely without any history! I have lived, as they say, keeping myself to myself, that is, utterly alone — alone, entirely alone. Do you know what it means to be alone?”

▪ So when we are unhappy we feel the unhappiness of others more; feeling is not destroyed but concentrated.

▪ when we have met at last after such a long separation — for I have known you for ages, Nastenka, because I have been looking for some one for ages, and that is a sign that it was you I was looking for, and it was ordained that we should meet now — at this moment a thousand valves have opened in my head, and I must let myself flow in a river of words, or I shall choke.

▪ how is it that we can’t all be like brothers together? Why is it that even the best of men always seem to hide something from other people and to keep something back? Why not say straight out what is in one’s heart, when one knows that one is not speaking idly? As it is every one seems harsher than he really is, as though all were afraid of doing injustice to their feelings, by being too quick to express them.”

▪ if you do not want to leave me alone to my fate, without hope, without consolation — if you are ready to love me always as you do now — I swear to you that gratitude . . . that my love will be at last worthy of your love. . . . Will you take my hand?”

▪ I don’t know how to be silent when my heart is speaking.

▪ I am a dreamer; I have so little real life that I look upon such moments as this now, as so rare, that I cannot help going over such moments again in my dreams.

▪ “Thank you, yes, thank you for that love! For it will live in my memory like a sweet dream which lingers long after awakening; for I shall remember for ever that instant when you opened your heart to me like a brother and so generously accepted the gift of my shattered heart to care for it, nurse it, and heal it.

▪ the memory of you will be exalted by a feeling of everlasting gratitude which will never be effaced from my soul. . . . I will treasure that memory: I will be true to it

▪ but you are an exception. I know you as though we had been friends for twenty years

▪ May your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart! My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man’s life?

▪ Do you know that I love now to recall and visit at certain dates the places where I was once happy in my own way?

▪ Listen, my dear good Nastenka, listen; I swear to you that if I am ever in a position to marry, you shall make my happiness. I assure you that now you are the only one who could make me happy. Listen, I am going to Moscow and shall be there just a year; I hope to establish my position. When I come back, if you still love me, I swear that we will be happy. Now it is impossible, I am not able, I have not the right to promise anything. Well, I repeat, if it is not within a year it will certainly be some time; that is, of course, if you do not prefer any one else, for I cannot and dare not bind you by any sort of promise.’


▪ Normal is not something to aspire to, it’s something to get away from.

▪ I didn’t waste that time. While I waited for clients at the airport or while they got smashed at the local watering hole, I sat in the limo and read. And read. I studied everything from finance to Internet programming to more autobiographies of the rich.

▪ My first few months in Phoenix I gained traction and survived on my own for the first time in my life. No flower boy. No busboy. No pizza delivery. No sponging off Mom with cheap rent. I was purely self-employed! It was a momentous acceleration, a wind at my back that foreshadowed a directional change into a new universe of wealth generation.

▪ Process makes millionaires, and the events you see and hear are the results of that process.

▪ All events of wealth are preceded by process, a backstory of trial, risk, hard work, and sacrifice. If you try to skip process, you’ll never experience events.

▪ The formula for wealth is like a cross-country road trip. Success demands your focused discipline into the journey and the journey’s tools (process) as opposed to the destination (event).

▪ If the road trip to wealth were easy, wouldn’t everyone be wealthy?

▪ If you don’t know where you are going, how will you know if you get there? An undefined destination means an undefined arrival. More than likely, you’ll end up where you don’t want to go.

▪ Self-made millionaires don’t become millionaires by stumbling into money. Likewise, financial failures don’t become failures by stumbling into poorness. Both are residual outcomes of the chosen financial roadmap and the actions and beliefs evolving from that roadmap. Your financial roadmap is definitive to process, and it’s the first tool for your road trip to wealth.

▪ Whether you know it or not, your current financial status is the aftermath of your financial roadmap. It guides your actions which renders consequences which renders your financial life.

▪ On the Sidewalk, you’re always “one something” from being homeless, bankrupt, or back living in your parent’s basement.

▪ Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F’s”: family (relationships), fitness (health), and freedom (choice).

▪ the more you try to look rich, the tighter the grip of poorness becomes.

▪ ➡Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up. ➡Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams. ➡Money buys the freedom to make a difference in the world. ➡Money buys the freedom to build and strengthen relationships.


▪ Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it. If you have to think about “affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences. If you buy a boat and resort to mental gymnastics over affordability, YOU CAN’T AFFORD IT. Sure you can assuage affordability and make outlandish arguments, often starting with “I can afford this as long as . . . I get that promotion.. . my mortgage doesn’t adjust. If you pay cash and your lifestyle doesn’t change regardless of future circumstances, you can afford it. In other words, if you buy a boat, pay cash, and are NOT be affected by unexpected “bumps in the road,” you can afford it. Would you regret a gum purchase if you lost your job a week later? Or if your sales forecast was slashed by 50%? Nope, it wouldn’t make a difference. This is how affordability is measured against your level of wealth.


▪ Wealth, like health, isn’t easy. Both are cut from the same fabric with identical processes. They require discipline, sacrifice, persistence, commitment, and yes, delayed gratification. If you can’t immunize yourself from the temptations of instant gratification, you’ll be hard pressed to find success in either health or wealth.

▪ I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work, the more I have of it.

▪ Bill also has a job in construction, except Bill spends his evenings surfing the Internet, researching the newest practices of inventing and engineering. Bill’s dream is to be an inventor and has created four prototypes of inventions in various fields. Bill also spends his vacation time at trade shows and marketing seminars.

▪ To take advantage of The Millionaire Fastlane understand that luck is a product of process, action, work, and being “out there.” And when you are “out there” you stand a chance at being in the right place at the right time. To create luck, engage in processes so probabilities move from nothing, to something. Luck is introduced when you play. If you don’t play, you can’t win.

▪ People who don’t take responsibility are victims. Some of them are born victims and, instead of trying to improve their hand, they fold and give up. For them, everyone has the solution to their problems but them. And their problems? Not their fault. Nope, someone else is to blame. Instead of looking within, they look outward and project responsibility to some other entity.

▪ when a financial adviser promises you 14% guaranteed income from a bank certificate of deposit and you later discover that he scammed you, it’s your fault. You didn’t do the diligence. You didn’t investigate. You ignored the tickle of logic in your brain. You are a victim of your own malfeasance.

▪ Wealth Equation: Wealth = job + market investments. Destination: A comfortable retirement in my twilight years. Responsibility & Control: It’s my responsibility to provide for my family although for that plan to work I have to rely on others, including Wall Street, my employer, my financial adviser, the government, and a good economy.

▪ Life Perception:

Settle for less. Give up on big dreams. Save, live frugal, don’t take unnecessary risks, and one day I will retire with millions.

▪ Wealth = (Primary Income Source: Job) + (Wealth Accelerator: Market Investments)

▪ I learned more as an entrepreneur in two months than I did working 10 years at dozens of dead-end jobs. The problem with a specialized skill set is, it narrows your useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs.

▪ Ask yourself this: Which experience is more important? The experience of a menial job designed to pay your bills? Or the experience (and failures) of creating something that could provide you financial freedom for a lifetime without ever having to hold a job again?

▪ Uncontrollable Limited Leverage is the disturbing evidence that proves the Slowlane’s futility. How do you get rich in the Slowlane? You get a great-paying job, save money, live frugal, invest in the stock market, and repeat for 50 years. If you mine this strategy into its mathematical constructs, you’ll find that the variables that define the plan cannot be controlled or leveraged.


▪ Many money gurus often suffer from a Paradox of Practice; they teach one wealth equation while getting rich in another. They’re not rich from their own teachings.

▪ The Slowlane HOPES you will live long enough to enjoy the fruits of your savings as you hit your late stage years.

▪ Sidewalk or Slowlane? Sacrifice today or tomorrow? You can walk the Sidewalk with no financial plan and convince yourself that today’s indulgences don’t have tomorrow’s consequences. Or, you can drive the Slowlane and gamble your today for the risky bet of a secure tomorrow. 

▪ The Fastlane is about building a better system, a better contraption, a better product, or a better “something” that will leverage your work. In the Slowlane, you are the source of heavy lifting, while in the Fastlane, you construct a system that does it for you.

▪ In the Fastlane, wealth is driven in a business system you create

▪ Reshape life’s focus on producing, not consuming.

▪ When you encounter an advertising message that coaxes you to buy something, examine it from the producer perspective. How does this company make money? What psychological tactics are used in its marketing messages? What kind of operational processes are involved in offering this product or service? Is this company making a profit? What is the revenue model? Is this product manufactured overseas or locally?

▪ To Consume Richly, Produce Effectively. To consume richly, produce richly first.

▪ when you unlock yourself from the handcuffs of time imposed by the Slowlane roadmap, you assign income to a system that leverages unlimited mathematics, and fast wealth becomes possible.

▪ Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go.

▪ Every dollar saved is another freedom fighter in your army. If your money is fighting for you, your time is freed and you break the equation of “time for money.”

▪ To activate compound interest’s power, start at the shore, with a large number that can be leveraged. Ten percent interest on $10 million is $1 million a year—$83,333 every single month.

▪ The leading cause of poorness is poor choices.

▪ Recognize that every day you make decisions that will ripple through the years. Question is, will your choice ripple to happiness and wealth? Or depression and poverty?

▪ If you want extraordinary results, you’re going to need extraordinary thinking. Unfortunately, “extraordinary” is not found trapped in society’s mediocracy and the beliefs that fuel them.

▪ WCCA asks you to answer three questions about every decision of consequence: (1)What is the worst-case consequence of this choice? (2)What is the probability of this outcome? (3)Is this an acceptable risk?

▪ The Weighted Average Decision Matrix (WADM)


▪ With WADM, decision-making is easy as it isolates and prioritizes factors relevant to your decisions and then quantifies each decision with a value. The higher value reflects the better decision.


▪ Today is the starting line for the rest of your life. Yes, today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday. The problem with the past is that we remember memories we shouldn’t, and we don’t forget what we should. If your eyes are stuck in the rearview mirror, you’re stuck in the past. If you’re stuck in the past, you’re not looking ahead. If you’re not looking ahead, you can’t hit the mark of your future.

▪ You can’t worry about deviating from social norms, because the norm is to be two paychecks from broke. If you want to push beyond average results produced by average people, you’ll need to adopt an uncommon approach that doesn’t fall in the favor of “everyone.”

▪ The more uncanny and exceptional you strive to be, the more you need to fight through social indoctrination. Extraordinary wealth will require you to have extraordinary beliefs.

▪ you need to pick better warriors to have on your team. How? Join entrepreneur clubs, attend networking events, ally yourself with like-minders, get yourself around people who subscribe to a Fastlane, anything-is-possible mindset, and decide who you want on your team of warriors. Read books and autobiographies of those who have the kind of success you want. Find a mentor.


▪ Time isn’t a commodity, something you pass around like a cake. Time is the substance of life. When anyone asks you to give your time, they’re really asking for a chunk of your life. Value your time poorly and you will be poor.


▪ The inconvenient saver desperately clutches onto every dollar, fearful it may never return. Extreme inconvenience is never a match for saving money. For example, an old friend of mine wanted an exercise bike and found it on sale at a store miles away her home. I told her just to buy the darn thing locally and pay the higher price, which was an extra $29. Nope, she was an inconvenient saver. Instead, she drove one hour to save $29. The inconvenient saver gladly wastes time to save money. From plane tickets with multiple stops to shared-shuttle airport service, inconvenience is no match for saving a few bucks an hour.

▪ Fastlaners exalt time as their primary consideration in decision-making because it’s our most valued asset. Fastlaners are frugal with time, while Slowlaners are frugal with money.

▪ If you want to be rich, you have to start thinking rich… Time is king.


▪ Education is what remains after one has forgotten everything he learned in school. ~ Albert Einstein

▪ Face it. What you know today is not enough to get you where you need to be tomorrow. You must constantly reinvent yourself, and reinvention is education. When you continually inject yourself with new education, new skills, and new competencies, new roads open and things run smoothly. The right education has incredible horsepower. New opportunities rarely follow an old education.

▪ Ask any successful entrepreneur and they will validate this truth: You learn from engagement, from doing, and from getting out and taking repeated action, more so than from any book or professor.

▪ Well, why don’t you know how? I’ll tell you why. You don’t know because you haven’t taught yourself how, nor have you wanted to “know how” badly enough. You see, it is easier to relent under the weight of “I don’t know how” than it is to actively pursue the knowledge.

▪ The greatest travesty of the free world is the underuse of knowledge. Walk into your local bookstore and inhale. Smell that? That’s the smell of infinite knowledge. Walk into your local library and look around. Amazing. Wall-to-wall books, free for the taking. Imagine if you could digest every book, every paragraph, and every sentence.

▪ Education is free for your consumption. Infinite knowledge is at your fingertips and the only thing preventing you from getting it is you. Yes, YOU.

▪ A committed Fastlaner has his nose in a book weekly. He attends seminars. He trolls business forums. He’s on Google or YouTube searching different topics and strategies.

▪ The best investment you can make is in yourself. So be willing to pay for your education now, or be prepared to pay a much bigger price for your lack of education later. The choices you make today will determine your financial future. Be sure you make the right choice, because you will have to live with the results of that choice.

▪ Set a goal to read at least 12 books per year, or one per month. If you are aggressive like me, you’ll read a book every week. I can’t stress enough that the more knowledge you consume, the more torque you create on the Fastlane road trip.

▪ If things seem under control, you are just not going fast enough.

▪ There’s a profound difference between interest and commitment. It is defined by the quality and consistency of your actions. Interest is looking rich; commitment is planning to be rich. Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, didn’t build the most-used social networking site by being interested. He was committed. Elon Musk didn’t improve rocketry by interest; he was committed. Interest is quitting after the third failure; commitment is continuing after the hundredth.

▪ Distance Yourself from “Most People”

▪ The idea of living in the rat race for 50 years has to be more painful than the idea of working your ass off to escape it.

▪ The brick walls are there for a reason. The brick walls are not there to keep us out; the brick walls are there to give us a chance to show how badly we want something. The brick walls are there to stop the people who don’t want it badly enough. They are there to stop the other people!

▪ Most people are consumers who are two paychecks from broke.

▪ you can’t experience success without failure. Failure is simply a natural response to success. If you avoid failure you will also avoid success.

▪ Take calculated risks. Do so and shit happens. You meet new people. New opportunities arise. Feedback pours in. “Lucky breaks” converge into your life. The act of doing does marvelous things.

▪ To live unlike everyone else, you have to do what everyone else won’t.

▪ The Law of Effection says to make millions you must impact millions.


▪ The Commandment of Entry states that as entry barriers to any business road fall, or lessen, the effectiveness of that road declines while competition in that field subsequently strengthens.

▪ Low-barrier-entry businesses are weak roads because easy entry creates high competition and high traffic, all of which share the same pie. And where there is traffic, there is no movement.

▪ “In a gold rush, don’t dig for gold, sell shovels!”

▪ When it comes to entry, your industry and your business should not be available to everyone, because if it is, you need to be exceptional. And if you are exceptional, easy entry becomes not a liability, but an asset. Ever get stuck in traffic on the expressway and go nowhere for hours? Welcome to “everyone is doing it.” A road full of traffic is a road full of everyone. If everyone is doing it, I won’t be doing it. I’ll exit the road, and you should too.

▪ When it comes to money, the best warning flag is “everyone.” Everyone is a red flag that the Commandment of Entry has been violated. If everyone is bewitched by the same activity, it surely will fail.

▪ How do I know when “everyone is doing it?” Simple. When there is irrational exuberance about any investment that pervades to Team Consumer—the general populous—that’s when I know it is time to GET OUT AND STAY OUT.

▪ But some shrewd people have mastered the Rule of Everyone. Instead of getting out, they short the other side and profit from the downfall With every busted boom, While the stock market imploded in early 2009, who was buying and who was selling? Everyone was selling. I was long gone and sold a year earlier. Warren Buffet was buying. Everyone sells and the richest man in the world buys. Hmmm. Could it be that everyone is wrong? Yes it could.

▪ If you want to live unlike everyone, you can’t be like everyone. Don’t confuse that with exceptionality. You have to lead the pack and have “everyone” follow.

▪ What do we live for, if not to make life less difficult for each other?  ~ George Eliot

▪ Businesses that solve needs and provide value win. Businesses that solve problems win profits.

▪ People care about what your business can do for them. How will it help them? What’s in it for them? Will it solve their problem? Make their life easier? Provide them with shelter? Save them money? Educate them? Make them feel something? Tell me, why on God’s green Earth should I give your business money? What value are you adding to my life?

▪ To succeed as a producer, surrender your own selfishness and address the selfishness of others.

▪ Never start a business just to make money. Stop chasing money and start chasing needs. Let me repeat that, because it’s the most important thing in this book: Stop thinking about business in terms of your selfish desires, whether it’s money, dreams or “do what you love.” Instead, chase needs, problems, pain points, service deficiencies, and emotions.

▪ You and your business attract money when you stop being selfish and turn your business’s focus from the needs of yourself to the needs of other people. Give first, take second. Needs come first, not money! Money isn’t attracted to selfish people. It is attracted to businesses that solve problems. It’s attracted to people who fill needs and add value. Solve needs massively and money massively attracts.The amount of money in your life is merely a reflection to the amount of value you have given to others.

▪ Make a freaking impact and start providing value! Let money come to you! Look around outside your world, stop being selfish, and help your fellow humans solve their problems. In a world of selfishness, become unselfish.

▪ Beware of another guru-speak: “Do what you love and the money will follow!” Bullshit. That is, unless you want to violate the Commandment of Need. For “do what you love” to work, you need two things: 1) Your love must solve a need and 2) You must be exceptional at it. “Doing what you love” for money often isn’t good enough because we aren’t good enough. Additionally, so many people are “doing what they love” that their markets get crowded and margins deflate. Heavy competition reigns. First, “do what you love” rarely creates money fast because more than likely, not only are YOU doing what you love but thousands of others are too (just tune into the first-week auditions for American Idol for proof). The need is weak. This saturates markets and makes profit margins shallow

▪ Take four years of hard work in exchange for 40 years of freedom.

▪ The cost of a thing is the amount of what I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in the long run. ~ HENRY DAVID THOREAU

▪ The Commandment of Time requires that your business and its income detach from your time. Can your business work for you while you aren’t? ✓Can this business be automated and systematized to operate while I’m absent? ✓Are my margins thick enough to hire human resource seedlings? ✓Can my operation benefit from the introduction of a money tree seedling? ✓How can I get this business to operate exclusive of my time?

▪ In business, to be a success you only have to be right once. ~ Mark Cuban


▪ the core inventing activity is just taking something and improving or modifying it. Take something old and stale and make it better. Take an underexposed product, make it your own, and reintroduce it to the world. Take something unconventional and make it conventional. You’ve got a great idea, but someone is already doing it? So what. Do it better.

▪ Successful businesses rarely evolve from some legendary idea. Nope, successful entrepreneurs take existing concepts and improve them. They take poorly met needs and solve them better. Skip the big idea and go for the big execution. You don’t need an idea that has never been done before. Old ideas suffice; just take it and do it better! Execute like no one has!

▪ When you catch yourself (or someone else) in these words, you’ve just uncovered a possible opportunity. Here are the most common phrases: “I hate . . .” What do you hate? Solve the hate, and there’s your open road. “I don’t like . . .” What don’t you like? Remove the dislike, and there’s your open road. “This frustrates me . . .”

What is frustrating? Remove the frustration, and there’s your open road. “Why is this like this?” I don’t know, why is it? Remove the “why,” and there’s your open road. “Do I have to? ”Do you? Remove the “have to.” There’s your open road. “I wish there was . . .” What do you wish? If you wish, others wish too. Make wishes come true, and there’s your open road. “I’m tired of . . .” What are you tired of? Fix someone’s tiresomeness, and there’s your open road. “This sucks . . .”

What sucks? Remove or reduce suckage, and there’s your open road.

▪ The world’s most successful entrepreneurs didn’t have a blockbuster ideas; they just took existing concepts and made them better, or exposed them to more people.

▪ The tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach. ~ Benjamin Mays

▪ Life is not about money, it’s about time

▪ Your destination is the lifestyle you want while having the freedom to enjoy it.

▪ Get started today by looking three feet in front of you, not three miles. A long gaze at the mountain crest will overwhelm you, so stop looking at it.

▪ I see this repeated at the Fastlane forum (TheFastlaneForum.com): “I’d like to make $5,000/month; how do I do this?” Aside from the flawed “money chasing” logic, the first step is to make $50/month. You can’t make $5,000 per month until you learn how to make $50 per month! It’s amazing how people love to skip process and want events. 


▪ To start your money system, find a quarter and drop it into a coffee can. Congratulations, you are 25 steps closer to your goal.



▪ If you don’t have $1,000 to fund the account, you can do it once you hit the $1,000 milestone. Your change bucket should yield about $500 per year. With an actual account, you can witness the real-time passivity of your money system. If you have $50,000 in your passive money system (not leveraged in a Fastlane pursuit) you can literally see your passive income stream every month in the form of either interest or dividends. For example, if you invested in a world bond fund for your money system and it yielded 6.5%, from $50,000 you’d generate $270 per month in passive income, each and every month.

▪ Now, I reiterate, Fastlane wealth is created by the net income and asset value—not by the stock market or compound interest. Your Fastlane business should fund this account, not savings from your paycheck.

▪ You can’t build a financial empire if you’re ignorant of basic finance and economics. These disciplines are the building blocks to a financial empire, and without them the Sidewalk becomes a danger.

▪ Remember, more money doesn’t solve money problems. If not educating yourself after graduation is one step on the Sidewalk, the other is not educating yourself on basic finance and economics.

▪ As kids, we aren’t taught money management or basic financial discipline. We’re abandoned in a financial jungle swarming with predators. Many perfectly intelligent people lack rudimentary knowledge of basic financial concept

▪ To successfully leverage a money system for passivity, you have to familiarize yourself with financial instruments that fuel the money system. Do you know how to calculate simple interest? Return on investment? Do you know what happens to the price of a bond when interest rates go up? Can you figure out the difference between a tax-free yield and a taxable yield?

▪ The first rule of financial literacy: “Live below your means.” Live below your means with the intent to expand your means.

▪ The fact is, most people—whether they agree with Fastlane strategy or not—will do nothing with the information. They’ll stare at the roadmap and agree with the mathematics, but never hit the road and the accelerator. It’s one thing to possess the treasure map; it’s another to get out of the house and follow it. Doing nothing is normal when it’s normalcy that you seek to avoid.

▪ Speed is uncovering a need and formulating a solution and a prototype. Speed is filing paperwork for your business entity. Speed is making contacts and forcing your process out into the world. Speed is approaching your business like a strategic game of chess while your opponents play checkers.

▪ An idea trapped in your brain is like a supercar trapped in the garage with a dead battery. It accomplishes nothing and its purpose is untapped. Execution is making an idea real and giving the battery a charge.

▪ Execution is getting that idea out of your mind on onto the roads of possibility.

▪ “I had that idea!” Oh yeah? Who cares. So did a thousand other people. What separates you from them? They executed. You didn’t, and you did nothing. Instead, you spent hours playing fantasy football. You spent the morning sleeping. You spent five days at a job. You chose everything but that great idea.

▪ “How can I find investors for my idea?” It doesn’t matter if the idea is an invention or a great new website, my answer is never what these people want to hear. If you want investors, get out and execute. Create a prototype. Create a brand. Create a track record that others can see or touch. Dive into process. When you have a physical manifestation of an idea, investors will open their wallets. Heck, be good enough and they will be fighting to give you money. 

▪ If you do build a great experience, customers tell each other about that. Word of mouth is very powerful. ~ Jeff Bezos

▪ Your customer service should serve one function, similar to our men of the cloth, and that is to “always be there”: help, support, and resolve.

▪ When the world unleashes its opinion on your new website, product, or concept, what should you expect? What should be addressed and what should be ignored? There are types of complaints: Complaints of void are when your customer continually requests something and you don’t have it. Complaints of void are extremely valuable, as they expose unmet needs.


▪ If you look at the life of the average-educated, hard-working person, there is a similar path. The child is born and goes to school. The proud parents are excited because the child excels, gets fair to good grades, and is accepted into a college. The child graduates, maybe goes on to graduate school and then does exactly as programmed: looks for a safe, secure job or career. The child finds that job, maybe as a doctor or a lawyer, or joins the Army or works for the government. Generally, the child begins to make money, credit cards start to arrive in mass, and the shopping begins, if it already hasn't.

▪ "Having money to burn, the child goes to places where other young people just like them hang out, and they meet people, they date, and sometimes they get married. Life is wonderful now, because today, both men and women work. Two incomes are bliss. They feel successful, their future is bright, and they decide to buy a house, a car, a television, take vacations and have children. The happy bundle arrives. The demand for cash is enormous. The happy couple decides that their careers are vitally important and begin to work harder, seeking promotions and raises. The raises come, and so does another child and the need for a bigger house. They work harder, become better employees, even more dedicated. They go back to school to get more specialized skills so they can earn more money. Maybe they take a second job. Their incomes go up, but so does the tax bracket they're in and the real estate taxes on their new large home, and their Social Security taxes, and all the other taxes. They get their large paycheck and wonder where all the money went. They buy some mutual funds and buy groceries with their credit card. The children reach 5 or 6 years of age, and the need to save for college increases as well as the need to save for their retirement. That happy couple, born 35 years ago, is now trapped in the Rat Race for the rest of their working days. They work for the owners of their company, for the government paying taxes, and for the bank paying off a mortgage and credit cards. Then, they advise their own children to `study hard, get good grades, and find a safe job or career.' They learn nothing about money, except from those who profit from their naïveté, and work hard all their lives. The process repeats into another hard-working generation. This is the `Rat Race'.”

▪ one dad had a habit of saying, “I can't afford it.” The other dad forbade those words to be used. He insisted I say, “How can I afford it?” One is a statement, and the other is a question. One lets you off the hook, and the other forces you to think. My soon-to-be-rich dad would explain that by automatically saying the words “I can't afford it,” your brain stops working. By asking the question “How can I afford it?” your brain is put to work.

▪ He was fanatical about exercising your mind, the most powerful computer in the world. “My brain gets stronger every day because I exercise it. The stronger it gets, the more money I can make.” He believed that automatically saying “I can't afford it” was a sign of mental laziness.

▪ One dad recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to work for.” The other recommended, “Study hard so you can find a good company to buy.” One dad said, “The reason I'm not rich is because I have you kids.” The other said, “The reason I must be rich is because I have you kids.” One encouraged talking about money and business at the dinner ,table. The other forbade the subject of money to be discussed over a meal. One said, “When it comes to money, play it safe, don't take risks.” The other said, “Learn to manage risk.” One believed, “Our home is our largest investment and our greatest asset.” The other believed, “My house is a liability, and if your house is your largest investment, you're in trouble.”

▪ I noticed that people really do shape their life through their thoughts.

▪ My rich dad, on the other hand, always referred to himself as rich. He would say things like, “I'm a rich man, and rich people don't do this.” Even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback, he continued to refer to himself as a rich man.

▪ He would cover himself by saying, “There is a difference between being poor and being broke. - Broke is temporary, and poor is eternal.”

▪ I noticed that my poor dad was poor not because of the amount of money he earned, which was significant, but because of his thoughts and actions.

▪ The other encouraged me to study to be rich, to understand how money works and to learn how to have it work for me. “I don't work for money!” were words he would repeat over and over, “Money works for me!”

▪ Two roads diverged in a wood, and I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.

▪ Money is one form of power. But what is more powerful is financial education. Money comes and goes, but if you have the education about how money works, you gain power over it and can begin building wealth.


▪ “That's how they teach you in school,” he said smiling. “But that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, `Wake up. There's something I want you to learn.'"" “If you learn life's lessons, you will do well. If not, life will just continue to push you around. People do two things. Some just let life push them around. Others get angry and push back. But they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it's life that's pushing.”

▪ Life pushes all of us around. Some give up. Others fight. A few learn the lesson and move on. They welcome life pushing them around. To these few people, it means they need and want to learn something. They learn and move on. Most quit, and a few like you fight.

▪ “The poor and the middle class work for money.” “The rich have money work for them.”

▪ My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. “Son, I want you to study hard, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has excellent benefits.” My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I could make it work for me. These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not because of a classroom.

▪ your dad went to school and got an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. Which he did. But he still has money problems because he never learned anything about money at school. On top of that, he believes in working for money.

▪ “And how did you feel when Mrs. Martin dropped three dimes in your hand for three hours' work?”

“I felt like it wasn't enough. It seemed like nothing. I was disappointed,” I said.

“And that is how most employees feel when they look at their paychecks. Especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken out. At least you got 100 percent.”

▪ Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years, and their education ends. I already know that my study of money will continue over my lifetime, simply because the more I Find out, the more I find out I need to know. Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and that's it. On top of that, they wonder why they have money problems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem. Few realize that it's their lack of financial education that is the problem.

▪ Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed

▪ the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set.

▪ The pattern of get up, go to work, pay bills, get up, go to work, pay bills... Their lives are then run forever by two emotions, fear and greed. Offer them more money, and they continue the cycle by also increasing their spending. This is what I call the Rat Race.

▪ they feel the fear of not having money. Instead of confronting the fear, they react instead of think. They react emotionally instead of using their heads,” rich dad said, tapping us on our heads. “'Then, they get a few bucks in their hands, and again the emotion of joy and desire and greed take over, and again they react, instead of think.”

▪ “So their emotions do their thinking,” Mike said.

▪ “That's correct,” said rich dad. "Instead of telling the truth about how they feel, they react to their feeling, fail to think. They feel the fear, they go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it doesn't. That old fear haunts them, and they go back to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn't. Fear has them in this trap of working, earning money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people, that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that.

▪ Let me finish the other emotion, which is desire. Some call it greed, but I prefer desire. It is perfectly normal to desire something better, prettier, more fun or exciting. So people also work for money because of desire. They desire money for the joy they think it can buy. But the joy that money brings is often short lived, and they soon need more money for more joy, more pleasure, more comfort, more security. So they keep working, thinking money will soothe their souls that is troubled by fear and desire. But money cannot do that

▪ the reason many rich people are rich is not because of desire but because of fear. They actually think that money can eliminate that fear of not having money, of being poor, so they amass tons of it only tofind out the fear gets worse. They now fear losing it. I have friends who keep working even though they have plenty. I know people who have millions who are more afraid now than when they were poor. They're terrified of losing all their money. The fears that drove them to get rich got worse. That weak and needy part of their soul is actually screaming louder. They don't want to lose the big houses, the cars, the high life that money has bought them. They worry about what their friends would say if they lost all their money. Many are emotionally desperate and neurotic, although they look rich and have more money.

▪ “I've met so many people who say, `Oh, I'm not interested in money.' Yet they'll work at a job for eight hours a day. That's a denial of truth. If they weren't interested in money, then why are they working? That kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who hoards money.

▪ just be an observer, not a reactor, to your emotions. Most people do not know that it's their emotions that are doing the thinking. Your emotions are your emotions, but you have got to learn to do your own thinking.

▪ When a person says, `I need to find a job,' it's most likely an emotion doing the thinking. Fear of not having money generates that thought.

▪ A job is really a short-term solution to a long-term problem.

▪ He's terrified that you won't be able to earn money and won't fit into society. Don't get me wrong. He loves you and wants the best for you. And I think his fear is justified. An education and a job are important. But it won't handle the fear. You see, that same fear that makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to be so fanatical about you going to school.

▪ I want to teach you to master the power of money. Not be afraid of it. And they don't teach that in school. If you don't learn it, you become a slave to money

▪ The main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance, not the economy or the government or the rich. It's selfinflicted fear and ignorance that keeps people trapped. 

▪ By not giving in to your emotions, you were able to delay your reactions and think. That is most important.

▪ We will always have emotions of fear and greed. From here on in, it is most important for you to use those emotions to your advantage and for the long term, and not simply let your emotions run you by controlling your thinking.

▪ To spend your life living in fear, never exploring your dreams, is cruel. To work hard for money, thinking that money will buy you things that will make you happy is also cruel. To wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live. To live a life dictated by the size of a paycheck is not really a life.

▪ Thinking that a job will make you feel secure is lying to yourself. That's cruel, and that's the trap I want you to avoid, if possible. I've seen how money runs people's lives. Don't let that happen to you. Please don't let money run your life.

▪ Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and so much fear

▪ Learn to use your emotions to think, not think with your emotions.

▪ If people are prepared to be flexible, keep an open mind and learn, they will grow richer and richer through the changes.

▪ Most people fail to realize that in life, it's not how much money you make, it's how much money you keep.

▪ We have all heard stories of lottery winners who are poor, then suddenly rich, then poor again. They win millions and are soon back to where they started. Or stories of professional athletes, who, at the age of 24, are earning millions of dollars a year, and are sleeping under a bridge by age 34.

▪ in the long run, it's not how much you make, it's how much you keep, and how many generations you keep it.

▪ If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.

▪ accounting is possibly the most boring subject in the world. It also could be the most confusing. But if you want to be rich, long term, it could be the most important subject.

▪ “Rich people acquire assets. The poor and middle class acquire liabilities, but they think they are assets”

▪ If you want to be rich, you've got to read and understand numbers.

▪ Income Statement, often called a Profit and Loss Statement. It measures income and expenses. Money in and money out.

▪ the Balance Sheet. It is called that because it is supposed to balance assets against liabilities.

▪ An asset is something that puts money in my pocket. A liability is something that takes money out of my pocket.

▪ If you want to be rich, simply spend your life buying assets. If you want to be poor or middle class, spend your life buying liabilities.

▪ The rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas than people who struggle financially. So if you want to be rich and maintain your wealth, it's important to be financially literate, in words as well as numbers.

▪ The diagrams show the flow of cash through a poor, middle class or wealthy person's life. It is the cash flow that tells the story. It is the story of how a person handles their money, what they do after they get the money in their hand.

▪ If your pattern is to spend everything you get, most likely an increase in cash will just result in an increase in spending.

▪ What is missing from their education is not how to make money, but how to spend money-what to do after you make it. It's called financial aptitude-what you do with the money once you make it, how to keep people from taking it from you, how long you keep it, and how hard that money works for you.

▪ Remember the golden rule. He who has the gold makes the rules.

▪ If a young couple would put more money into their asset column early on, their later years would get easier, especially as they prepared to send their children to college. Their assets would have grown and would be available to help cover expenses

▪ Educated Dad's Financial Statement: Income=Expense Asset < Liability. Rich Dad's Financial Statement : Income > Expense, Asset > Liability.

▪ The asset column generates more than enough income to cover expenses, with the balance reinvested into the asset column. The asset column continues to grow and, therefore, the income it produces grows with it.

▪ The middle class finds itself in a constant state of financial struggle. Their primary- income is through wages, and as their wages increase, so do their taxes. Their expenses tend to increase in equal increments as their wages increase

▪ Why the Middle Class Struggle Income goes up, Expenses go up Assets do not increase, Liabilities do increase.

▪ This pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that a pay raise means you can buy a larger home or spend more is the foundation of today's debt-ridden society

▪ As I said at the start of this section, the most important rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability. Once you understand the difference, concentrate your efforts on only buying income-generating assets. That's the best way to get started on a path to becoming rich. Keep doing that, and your asset column will grow. Focus on keeping liabilities and expenses down. This will make more money available to continue pouring into the asset column. Soon, the asset base will be so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments. Investments that may have returns of 100 percent to infinity.

▪ You need to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and your family directly.

▪ Once you have decided to concentrate on minding your own business, how do you set your goals? For most people, they must keep their profession and rely on their wages to fund their acquisition of assets. As their assets grow, how do they measure the extent of their success? When does someone realize that they are rich, that they have wealth? As well as having my own definitions for assets and liabilities, I also have my own definition for wealth. Actually I borrowed it from a man named Buckminster Fuller. Some call him a quack, and others call him a living genius. Years ago he got all the architects buzzing because he applied for a patent in 1961 for something called a geodesic dome. But in the application, Fuller also said something about wealth. It was pretty confusing at first, but after reading it for awhile, it began to make some sense: Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward... or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?

▪ Wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the asset column compared with the expense column.


▪ So I am not yet rich, but I am wealthy. I now have income generated from assets each month that fully cover my monthly expenses. If I want to increase my expenses, I first must increase my cash flow from assets to maintain this level of wealth. Take notice that it is at this point that I no longer am dependent on my wages. I have focused on and been successful in building an asset column that has made me financially independent. If I quit my job today, I would be able to cover my monthly expenses with the cash flow from my assets.

▪ My next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the asset column. The more money that goes into my asset column, the more my asset column grows. The more my assets grow, the more my cash flow grows. And as long as I keep my expenses less than the cash flow from these assets, I will grow richer, with more and more income from sources other than my physical labor.

▪ Financial struggle is often directly the result of people working all their life for someone else. Many people will have nothing at the end of their working days.


▪ I kept my daytime job, but I still minded my own business. I was active in my asset column. I traded real estate and small stocks.

▪ Rich dad always stressed the importance of financial literacy. The better I was at understanding the accounting and cash management, the better I would be at analyzing investments and eventually starting and building my own company.

▪ I would not encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to. Knowing what I know about running a company, I would not wish that task on anyone.

▪ Nine out of 10 companies fail in five years. Of those that survive the first five years, nine out of every 10 of those eventually fail, as well. So only if you really have the desire to own your own company do I recommend it.

▪ Otherwise, keep your daytime job and mind your own business. When I say mind your own business, 1 mean to build and keep your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee. The best thing about money is that it works 24 hours a day and can work for generations.

▪ Keep your daytime job, be a great hard-working employee, but keep building that asset column.

▪ An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first.

▪ The old-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first. Then, the income generated from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood and children's inheritance.

▪ knowledge was power. And with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multiply

▪ The first lesson of having money work for me, as opposed to working for money, is really all about power. If you work for money, you give the power up to your employer. If your money works for you, you keep and control the power.

▪ You need to know the law and how the system works. If you're ignorant, it is easy to be bullied. If you know what you're talking about, you have a fighting chance.

▪ He knew the law because it was expensive to not know the law.

▪ If you know you're right, you're not afraid of fighting back.

▪ financial IQ is made up of knowledge from four broad areas of expertise. No. 1 is accounting. What I call financial literacy. A vital skill if you want to build an empire. The more money you are responsible for, the more accuracy is required. Financial literacy is the ability to read and understand financial statements. This ability allows you to identify the strengths and weaknesses of any business. No. 2 is investing. What I call the science of money making money. This involves strategies and formulas. This is the right brain side, or the creative side. No. 3 is understanding markets. The science of supply and demand.


▪ We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. Often in the real world, it's not the smart that get ahead but the bold.


▪ I recommend to young people to seek work for what they will learn, more than what they will earn. Look down the road at what; skills they want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the “Rat Race.”

▪ The better you are at communicating, negotiating and handling your fear of rejection, the easier life is.


▪ it's not fear that is the problem. It's how you handle fear. It's how you handle losing. It's how you handle failure that makes the difference in one's life.



▪ Do what you feel in your heart to be right-for you'll be criticized anyway. You'll be damned if you do, and damned if you don't.

▪ When you know you are ignorant in a subject, start educating yourself by finding an expert in the field or find a book on the subject.






▪ without a strong reason or purpose, anything in life is hard.


▪ Most people simply buy investments rather than first invest in learning about investing.

▪ if you learn something new, you are then required to make mistakes in order to fully understand what you have learned.

▪ I've noticed that my friends with money talk about money. And I do not mean brag. They're interested in the subject. So I learn from them, and they learn from me.

▪ I would say that one of the hardest things about wealth building is to be true to yourself and be willing to not go along with the crowd.

▪ If a great deal is on the front page, it's too late in most instances. Look for a new deal. As we used to say as surfers: “There is always another wave.





▪ Wise investors buy an investment when it's not popular.

▪ The reason you want to have rich friends who are close to the inside is because that is where the money is made. It's made on information. You want to hear about the next boom, get in and get out before the next bust.



▪ “You become what you study.” In other words, be careful what you study and learn, because your mind is so powerful that you become what you put in your head.



▪ The power of self-discipline. If you cannot get control of yourself, do not try to get rich.

▪ people who have low self-esteem and low tolerance for financial pressure can never, and I mean never, be rich.



▪ The rich know that savings are only used to create more money, not to pay bills.


▪ The earlier you can train yourself and those you love to be masters of money, the better. Money is a powerful force. Unfortunately, people use the power of money against them. If your financial intelligence is low, money will run all over you. It will be smarter than you. If money is smarter than you, you will work for it all your life.


▪ If I could leave one single idea with you, it is that idea. Whenever you feel “short” or in “need” of something, give what you want first and it will come back in buckets.

▪ Stop doing what you're doing. In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Stop doing what is not working and look for something new to do.

▪ Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask them for tips

▪ Make offers. Someone might say “yes.”

▪ Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the right investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go to the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, counteroffers, negotiate, reject and accept.


▪ What we really want is to know we’re not alone in our terribleness. We want to appreciate the failure that makes us perfectly us and wonderfully relatable to every other person out there who is also pretending that they have their shit together and didn’t just eat that onion ring that fell on the floor.

▪ But we don’t get to pick who we are. I am still as broken as I was before, but with better stories and a little more insight into just how fucked up I am.

▪ It might seem strange to start a story with an ending. But all endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.

▪ By his 83rd birthday, Eddie had lost nearly everyone he'd cared about. Some had died young, and some had been given a chance to grow old before a disease or an accident took them away.

▪ "This is the greatest gift God can give you: to understand what happened in your life. To have it explained. It is the peace you have been searching for."

▪ Fairness," he said, "does not govern life and death. If it did, no good person would ever die young."

▪ "Dying? Not the end of everything. We think it is. But what happens on earth is only the beginning."

▪ That's what heaven is. You get to make sense of your yesterdays."

▪ That's the thing. Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just passing it on to someone else."

▪ Which was worse when left unexplained: a life, or a death?

▪ "Learn this from me. Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.

▪ "That's because no one is born with anger. And when we die, the soul is freed of it. But now, here, in order to move on, you must understand why you felt what you did, and why you no longer need to feel it."

▪ in order to move on, you must understand why you felt what you did, and why you no longer need to feel it."

▪ PEOPLE SAY THEY "find" love, as if it were an object hidden by a rock. But love takes many forms, and it is never the same for any man and woman. What people find then is a certain love. And Eddie found a certain love with Marguerite, a grateful love, a deep but quiet love, one that he knew, above all else, was irreplaceable. Once she'd gone, he'd let the days go stale. He put his heart to sleep.

▪ Lost love is still love, Eddie. It takes a different form, that's all. You can't see their smile or bring them food or tousle their hair or move them around a dance floor. But when those senses weaken, another heightens. Memory. Memory becomes your partner. You nurture it. You hold it. You dance with it.

▪ "Life has to end," she said. "Love doesn't."

▪ that each affects the other and the other affects the next, and the world is full of stories, but the stories are all one.
