▪ People of all ages and walks of life discount the future

▪ This isn’t a twentysomething tendency. It’s a human tendency, one that underpins addiction, procrastination, health, oil consumption, and, yes, saving for retirement.

▪ Present

▪ Once she could envision what she wanted her thirtysomething life to look like, what to do with the twentysomething years became more urgent and more defined. A timeline may not be a virtual reality chamber, but it can help our brains see time for what it really is: limited. It can give us a reason to get up in the morning and get going.

▪ Our twenties are w


hen we have to start creating our own sense of time, our own plans about how the years ahead will unfold. It is difficult to know how to start our careers or when to start our families. It is tempting to stay distracted and keep everything at a distance. But twentysomethings who live beyond time usually aren’t happy. It’s like living in a cave where we never know what time it is or what we ought to do or why, sometimes until it is too late.

▪ Most twentysomethings can’t write the last sentence of their lives, but when pressed, they usually can identify things they want in their thirties or forties or sixties—or things they don’t want—and work backward from there. This is how you have your own multigenerational epic with a happy ending. This is how you live your life in real time.

▪ The future isn’t written in the stars. There are no guarantees. So claim your adulthood. Be intentional. Get to work. Pick your family. Do the math. Make your own certainty. Don’t be defined by what you didn’t know or didn’t do.
...Toltecs (scientists and artists who formed a society to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the ancient ones.)

▪ our biggest fear is taking the risk to be alive — the risk to be alive and express what we really are. Just being ourselves is the biggest fear of humans. We have learned to live our lives trying to satisfy other people’s demands. We have learned to live by other people’s points of view because of the fear of not being accepted and of not being good enough for someone else.

▪ We know we are not what we believe we are supposed to be and so we feel false, frustrated, and dishonest. We try to hide ourselves, and we pretend to be what we are not. The result is that we feel unauthentic and wear social masks to keep others from noticing this. We are so afraid that somebody else will notice that we are not what we pretend to be.

▪ We judge others according to our image of perfection as well, and naturally they fall short of our expectations.

▪ In your whole life nobody has ever abused you more than you have abused yourself. And the limit of your self-abuse is exactly the limit that you will tolerate from someone else. If someone abuses you a little more than you abuse yourself, you will probably walk away from that person. But if someone abuses you a little less than you abuse yourself, you will probably stay in the relationship and tolerate it endlessly.

▪ We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot accept and love ourselves. The more self-love we have, the less we will experience self-abuse. Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and never measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we reject ourselves; it is why we don’t accept ourselves the way we are, and why we don’t accept others the way they are.

▪ The human mind is like a fertile ground where seeds are continually being planted. The seeds are opinions, ideas, and concepts. You plant a seed, a thought, and it grows. The word is like a seed, and the human mind is so fertile! The only problem is that too often it is fertile for the seeds of fear. Every human mind is fertile, but only for those kinds of seeds it is prepared for. What is important is to see which kind of seeds our mind is fertile for, and to prepare it to receive the seeds of love.

▪ A sin is anything that you do which goes against yourself. Everything you feel or believe or say that goes against yourself is a sin. You go against yourself when you judge or blame yourself for anything. Being without sin is exactly the opposite. Being impeccable is not going against yourself.

▪ Being impeccable with your word is the correct use of your energy; it means to use your energy in the direction of truth and love for yourself.

▪ the mitote, the chaos of a thousand different voices all trying to talk at once in the mind.

▪ If you understand the first agreement, be impeccable with your word, you begin to see all the changes that can happen in your life. Changes first in the way you deal with yourself, and later in the way you deal with other people, especially those you love the most.

▪ Use the word in the correct way. Use the word to share your love. Use white magic, beginning with yourself. Tell yourself how wonderful you are, how great you are. Tell yourself how much you love yourself. Use the word to break all those teeny, tiny agreements that make you suffer.

▪ this person is dealing with his or her own feelings, beliefs, and opinions. That person tried to send poison to you and if you take it personally


, then you take that poison and it becomes yours. Taking things personally makes you easy prey for these predators, the black magicians. They can hook you easily with one little opinion and feed you whatever poison they want, and because you take it personally, you eat it up.

 It is not important to me what you think about me, and I don’t take what you think personally. I don’t take it personally when people say, “Miguel, you are the best,” and I also don’t take it personally when they say, “Miguel, you are the worst.” I know that when you are happy you will tell me, “Miguel, you are such an angel!” But, when you are mad at me you will say, “Oh, Miguel, you are such a devil! You are so disgusting. How can you say those things?” Either way, it does not affect me because I know what I am. I don’t have the need to be accepted. I don’t have the need to have someone tell me, “Miguel, you are doing so good!” or “How dare you do that!”

No, I don’t take it personally. Whatever you think, whatever you feel, I know is your problem and not my problem. It is the way you see the world. It is nothing personal, because you are dealing with yourself, not with me. Others are going to have their own opinion according to their belief system, so nothing they think about me is really about me, but it is about them.

You may even tell me, “Miguel, what you are saying is hurting me.” But it is not what I am saying that is hurting you; it is that you have wounds that I touch by what I have said. You are hurting yourself. There is no way that I can take this personally. Not because I don’t believe in you or don’t trust you, but because I know that you see the world with different eyes, with your eyes. You create an entire picture or movie in your mind, and in that picture you are the director, you are the producer, you are the main actor or actress. Everyone else is a secondary actor or actress. It is your movie.

▪ When you make it a strong habit not to take anything personally, you avoid many upsets in your life. Your anger, jealousy, and envy will disappear, and even your sadness will simply disappear if you don’t take things personally.

...We make all sorts of assumptions because we don’t have the courage to ask questions.

▪ These assumptions are made so fast and unconsciously most of the time because we have agreements to communicate this way. We have agreed that it is not safe to ask questions; we have agreed that if people love us, they should know what we want or how we feel. When we believe something, we assume we are right about it to the point that we will destroy relationships in order to defend our position.

▪ Often when you go into a relationship with someone you like, you have to justify why you like that person. You only see what you want to see and you deny there are things you don’t like about that person. You lie to yourself just to make yourself right. Then you make assumptions, and one of the assumptions is “My love will change this person.” But this is not true. Your love will not change anybody. If others change, it’s because they want to change, not because you can change them. Then something happens between the two of you, and you get hurt. Suddenly you see what you didn’t want to see before, only now it is amplified by your emotional poison. Now you have to justify your emotional pain and blame them for your choices.

▪ The way to keep yourself from making assumptions is to ask questions. Make sure the communication is clear. If you don’t understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be, and even then do not assume you know all there is to know about a given situation. Once you hear the answer, you will not have to make assumptions because you will know the truth.

▪ Under any circumstance, always do your best, no more and no less. But keep in mind that your best is never going to be the same from one moment to the next

▪ You can have many great ideas in your head, but what makes the difference is the action. Without action upon an idea, there will be no manifestation,


no results, and no reward.

▪ The best way to say, “Thank you, God,” is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. Whatever life takes away from you, let it go. When you surrender and let go of the past, you allow yourself to be fully alive in the moment. Letting go of the past means you can enjoy the dream that is happening right now.

▪ If you live in a past dream, you don’t enjoy what is happening right now because you will always wish it to be different than it is. There is no time to miss anyone or anything because you are alive. Not enjoying what is happening right now is living in the past and being only half alive. This leads to self-pity, suffering, and tears.

We don’t need to know or prove anything. Just to be, to take a risk and enjoy your life, is all that matters. Say no when you want to say no, and yes when you want to say yes. You have the right to be you. You can only be you when you do your best. When you don’t do your best you are denying yourself the right to be you. That’s a seed that you should really nurture in your mind. You don’t need knowledge or great philosophical concepts. You don’t need the acceptance of others. You express your own divinity by being alive and by loving yourself and others. It is an expression of God to say, “Hey, I love you.”

▪ Don’t expect that you will never take anything personally; just do your best. Don’t expect that you will never make another assumption, but you can certainly do your best

▪ By doing your best, the habits of misusing your word, taking things personally, and making assumptions will become weaker and less frequent with time. You don’t need to judge yourself, feel guilty, or punish yourself if you cannot keep these agreements.

▪ The freedom we are looking for is the freedom to be ourselves, to express ourselves. But if we look at our lives we will see that most of the time we do things just to please others, just to be accepted by others, rather than living our lives to please ourselves. That is what has happened to our freedom.

▪ There are three masteries that lead people to become Toltecs. First is the Mastery of Awareness. This is to be aware of who we really are, with all the possibilities. The second is the Mastery of Transformation — how to change, how to be free of domestication. The third is the Mastery of Intent. Intent from the Toltec point of view is that part of life that makes transformation of energy possible; it is the one living being that seamlessly encompasses all energy, or what we call “God.” Intent is life itself; it is unconditional love. The Mastery of Intent is therefore the Mastery of Love.

▪ The parasite can be compared to a monster with a thousand heads. Every head of the parasite is one of the fears that we have. If we want to be free, we have to destroy the parasite. One solution is to attack the parasite head by head, which means we face each of our fears, one by one. This is a slow process, but it works. Every time we face one of the fears we are a little more free.

...We have learned that the dream you are living now is the result of the outside dream hooking your attention and feeding you all of your beliefs. The process of domestication can be called the dream of the first attention because it was how your attention was used for the first time to create the first dream of your life.

▪ One way to change your beliefs is to focus your attention on all those agreements and beliefs, and change the agreements with yourself. In doing this you are using your attention for the second time, thus creating the dream of the second attention or the new dream.

▪ The difference is that you are no longer innocent. When you were a child this was not true; you didn’t have a choice. But you are no longer a child. Now it’s up to you to choose what to believe and what not to believe. You can choose to believe in anything, and that includes believing in yourself.

▪ to really change your beliefs you need to focus your attention on what it is that you want to change. You have to know which agreements you want to change before you can change them.

▪ So the next step is to develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy. You take an inventory of all that you believe, all your agreements, and through this process you begin the transformation.

▪ For example, the little girl who was told not to sing is now twenty years old and she still does not sing. One way she can overcome the belief that her voice is ugly is to say, “Okay, I will try to sing, even if I do sing badly.” Then she can pretend that someone is clapping and telling her, “Oh! That was beautiful.” This may break the agreement a teeny, tiny bit, but it will still be there. However, now she has a little more power and courage to try again and again until finally she breaks the agreement.

▪ There are many strong beliefs in the mind that can make this process look hopeless. This is why you need to go step-by-step and be patient with yourself because this is a slow process. The way you are living now is the result of many years of domestication. You cannot expect to break the domestication in one day.
...

All of these old agreements which rule our dream of life are the result of repeating them over and over again. Therefore, to adopt the Four Agreements, you need to put repetition in action. Practicing the new agreements in your life is how your best becomes better. Repetition makes the master.

▪ Every day we awake with a certain amount of mental, emotional, and physical energy that we spend throughout the day. If we allow our emotions to deplete our energy, we have no energy to change our lives or to give to others.

▪ We must forgive those we feel have wronged us, not because they deserve to be forgiven, but because we love ourselves so much we don’t want to keep paying for the injustice.

▪ Forgiveness is the only way to heal. We can choose to forgive because we feel compassion for ourselves. We can let go of the resentment and declare, “That’s enough! I will no longer be the big Judge that goes against myself. I will no longer beat myself up and abuse myself. I will no longer be the Victim.”

▪ First, we need to forgive our parents, our brothers, our sisters, our friends, and God. Once you forgive God, you can finally forgive yourself. Once you forgive yourself, the self-rejection in your mind is over. Self-acceptance begins, and the self-love will grow so strong that you will finally accept yourself just the way you are. That’s the beginning of the free human. Forgiveness is the key.

▪ You will know you have forgiven someone when you see them and you no longer have an emotional reaction. You will hear the name of the person and you will have no emotional reaction. When someone can touch what used to be a wound and it no longer hurts you, then you know you have truly forgiven.

▪ The problem with most people is that they lose control of their emotions. It is the emotions that control the behavior of the human, not the human who controls the emotions. When we lose control we say things that we don’t want to say, and do things that we don’t want to do.

▪ We must learn to control the emotions so we have enough personal power to change our fear-based agreements, escape from hell, and create our own personal heaven.

▪ The warrior has awareness. That’s very important. We are aware that we are at war, and the war in our minds requires discipline. Not the discipline of a soldier, but the discipline of a warrior. Not the discipline from the outside to tell us what to do and what not to do, but the discipline to be ourselves, no matter what.

...The warrior has control. Not control over another human, but control over one’s own emotions, control over one’s own self. It is when we lose control that we repress the emotions, not when we are in control. The big difference between a warrior and a victim is that the victim represses, and the warrior refrains. Victims repress because they are afraid to show the emotions, afraid to say what they want to say. To refrain is


not the same thing as repression. To refrain is to hold the emotions and to express them in the right moment, not before, not later. That is why warriors are impeccable. They have complete control over their own emotions and therefore over their own behavior.

▪ we only have one week to live, let’s enjoy life. Let’s be alive. We can say, “I’m going to be myself. No longer am I going to run my life trying to please other people. No longer am I going to be afraid of what they think about me. What do I care what others think if I am going to die in one week? I’m going to be myself.”

▪ Imagine living your life without the fear of being judged by others. You no longer rule your behavior according to what others may think about you. You are no longer responsible for anyone’s opinion. You have no need to control anyone, and no one controls you, either.
When we understand a little about how our minds work and we have some guideposts on how to deal with our emotions in a healthy way, we not only build resilience, but we can thrive and, over time, find a sense of growth.

▪ When I am feeling this, what am I thinking about? When I am feeling this, what state is my body in? How was I looking after myself in the days or hours leading up to this feeling? Is this an emotion or just physical discomfort from an unmet need?

▪ Mood fluctuation is normal. Nobody is happy all the time. But we don’t have to be at the mercy of it either. There are things we can do that help.

▪ Low mood gives us the urge to do things that can make our mood even worse.

▪ we feel urges to do whatever will make it all go away as soon as possible. We numb or distract ourselves, and push the feelings away. For some that is via alcohol, drugs or food. For others it is watching hours of TV or scrolling through social media. Each of those things are so inviting because they work – in the short term. They give us that instant distraction and numbing that we crave.

▪ When feeling low, what are your go-to responses?
Do those responses provide instant relief from the pain and discomfort?
What effect do they have in the long term?
What do they cost you? (Not in money, but in time, effort, health, progress.)

▪ the relationship between thoughts and feelings goes both ways. The thoughts we spend time with affect how we feel, but how we feel also has an effect on the thought patterns that come up.

▪ For example, we set ourselves a rule for living, something like, ‘I must always be on time for everything.’ We then apply that rule to others and feel offended or hurt when they fall short of that. That might make us feel less tolerant of others, disrupt our mood even further and add relationship tensions into the mix. This equates with trying to control the uncontrollable and inevitably sends our low mood spiralling down further.

▪ If we can acknowledge that each of our thoughts presents just one possible idea among many, then we open ourselves up to the possibility of considering others.

▪ Start keeping a journal and choose specific moments to focus on (both positive and negative). Make a distinction between what you were thinking at the time, what emotions you noticed and what physical sensations came with that. Once you have the thoughts written down, go over the list of biases and see if your thoughts might have been biased at the time.
...try to use language that helps you get some distance from those thoughts and feelings. For example, I am having thoughts that … or I am noticing these sensations. This use of language helps you to step back from the thoughts and feelings, to see them as an experience


that is washing over you, rather than an absolute truth.

▪ Having a set time of the day when you pay attention to your thoughts is a great idea. It’s your formal practice to build that ability to step back from your thoughts and observe them without judgement.

▪ If I can spot that bias and call it out, I can open up this window of opportunity in which I can reduce the intensity of that emotional response that might otherwise follow.

▪ Get some distance from those thoughts by becoming familiar with the common biases, noticing when they appear and labelling them as biases, not facts.

▪ Metacognition is the process of stepping back from the thoughts and getting enough distance to allow us to see those thoughts for what they really are.

▪ Your attention is valuable and helps to create your experience of life. So learning to control where you direct it can have a powerful impact on your life and your mood.

▪ Gratitude practice is another simple way to get used to turning your attention. Find a small notebook and, once a day, write down three things that you feel grateful for. They can be something big like your loved ones, or it can be a small detail of your day that you appreciate, such as the taste of your coffee as you sit down to work.

▪ Write down three things you feel thankful for. They can be the larger, more profound aspects of your life or the tiniest of details from your day. What matters is not what you choose to include, but the practice of turning your attention on purpose.

▪ Doing this once is nice. Doing it every day is a life practice that builds the mental muscle to choose where you focus your attention and allows you to experience the benefits.

▪ Thoughts are not facts. They are suggestions offered up to us by the brain to help us make sense of the world.

▪ The problem with decision-making when you feel down is that low mood gives us the urge to do things that we know will keep us stuck. But the things that we know could help feel overwhelming.

▪ When dealing with low mood, focus on your personal values around health. What is important to you about your physical and mental health? How do you want to be living your daily life in a way that expresses that? How much are you living in line with those values at the moment? What is one thing you could do today that would steer you in the direction of looking after your health in the way you want to?

▪ Low mood increases any self-criticism or self-attack that we already do.
...

...We can’t stop those thoughts arriving. But we can build our ability to notice them and respond in a way that gives them less power over how we feel and behave.

▪ Figuring out what you can do to change how you feel

Start by filling in the hot cross bun formulation for the low mood scenario

▪ Once you have broken down the thoughts and behaviours that are contributing to your low mood, fill in the blank formulation for your better days (see page 348). This time, start with the emotions box and fill it with the emotions you would like to feel more of in your everyday life instead of the low mood.

▪ When you have felt that way in the past, what has been the focus of your attention?
What might your thoughts/self-talk need to sound like in order for you to feel that way?
When you have felt that way before, how did you behave? What did you do more of or less of?
If you were to feel that way, how would you need to be treating your body?
When you are feeling at your best, what do your thoughts sound like?
What do you tend to be focused on? What does that inner voice sound like then?

▪ Keep vigorous exercise to earlier in the day and try using the evenings for relaxation.

▪ A warm bath before bed can help your body reach a temperature that is optimal for sleep.

▪ In the evening, when the sun goes down, keep lights low.

▪ the research suggests it is less about the colour of the screen light and more about the brightness

▪ turn down the brightness on screens in the evening as much as possible and switch them off altogether as early as possible.

▪ Make time in the day to tackle things you are worried about. Make your decisions, make your plans, take something off your to-do list. Getting good sleep is also about what you do during the day. We are much better at problem-solving during the daylight hours, but if we push those problems away and ignore them, they tend to pop up at night when we are trying to sleep. So clear the desk and clear your mind as much as you can.
 nurturing good quality relationships is one of the most powerful tools we have in maintaining good mental health throughout the lifespan

▪ 

▪ When we start to change what we are doing with the body, it has an influence on the activity in the brain, which in turn influences the feelings that are produced in the body.

▪ You cannot change something you are not aware of.

▪ If we associate failure with unworthiness, then starting anything new is going to feel overwhelming and procrastination will be front and centre. We protect ourselves from the psychological threat of shame by sabotaging the process before it gets started.

▪ So if we want to persist at something and feel motivated to keep trying, we have to think carefully about how we respond to failure along the way.

▪ Self-compassion, on the other hand, treating yourself with kindness, respect, honesty and encouragement after a failure, is associated with increased motivation and better outcomes

▪ The opposite action skill is the deliberate attempt to take an action that is the opposite of what the emotion is telling you to do.

▪ But

▪ But if we use those in-between moments to clear emails, scroll through social media or get a few things done, the body and brain will not be returning to a rest state to recharge. So the next time you reach for your phone to fill the 15 minutes between meetings, why not step outside for some fresh air or find a space to close your eyes for a moment instead?

▪ Describe any significant events that happened.
What thoughts did you have at the time?
How did that way of thinking impact on how you felt?
Describe any emotions you noticed.
What triggered those emotions?
What urges did you have?
How did you respond to the feeling?
What were the consequences of your response?

▪ It’s not always clear what we need to change and how to do it.
You cannot change what you cannot make sense of.

▪ Get to know your problem inside out to make it easier to identify which way to go next.

▪ Start by reflecting on situations after they have happened.
...Be ready to get honest with yourself about ways you may contribute to the problem or keep yourself stuck.

▪ Notice the words others use, read books and explore the ways you can keep building your emotional vocabulary.

▪ William Worden (2011) described what he thought were the four tasks of mourning.

1. To find some acceptance in the new reality after the loss.
2. To work through the pain of grief.
3. To adjust to an environment in which that loved one is missing.
4. To find a way to keep a connection with them in a new way while also engaging in life as it is now.

▪ Write down the situation in which you would like to build more confidence. Put the most vulnerable situation at the top. Then list any variations of that situation that may feel more manageable but still challenging.

▪ For example, if I want to build my confidence in social situations, I may put parties at the top of the list as the occasion in which I feel least confident. Slightly easier than that might be a party at which I know everyone. Easier than that might be a small gathering of close friends. Easier still might be going to a café with a trusted friend. Once you have your list, you don’t start at the top. You take the scenario that presents a challenge but still feels possible. You then repeat that behaviour as often as you can. Once your confidence grows and that situation becomes a comfort zone, you move up to the next thing on the list.

▪ To build confidence, go where you have none. Repeat every day and watch your confidence develop.

▪ Something that has helped me a lot is understanding that how other people respond to my failures do


es not provide an accurate assessment of my personality and worthiness as a human, but instead indicates how that person relates to failure.

▪ ‘When I look back on this time, what choices would I be proud of? What actions could I take that I will be grateful I took a year from now? How can I learn from this and keep moving forward?’

▪ Let’s say that from the moment you closed this book you started living your life with unconditional self-acceptance. What would that look like? What would you do differently? What would you say yes to? What would you say no to? What would you work harder on? What would you let go of? How would you speak to yourself? How would you speak to others?

▪ Try writing down your answers to those questions in great detail and create a vision of how the idea of self-acceptance would translate into behaviour change for you.

▪ if you want to feel less anxious about something, do it as often as you can.

▪ Any time that you want to get some distance and a new perspective on your emotional state or situation, write down everything you are thinking and feeling.
So actively focusing on how to develop friendship and working on what it takes to be a better friend is a good idea.

 “Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,” he told me, “just remember that all the people in this world haven’t had the advantages that you’ve had.”

▪ No amount of fire or freshness can challenge what a man can store up in his ghostly heart.

▪ “You can’t repeat the past.” 

“Can’t repeat the past?” he cried incredulously. “Why of course you can!”

▪ “They’re a rotten crowd,” I shouted across the lawn. “You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”

▪ I’ve always been glad I said that. It was the only compliment I ever gave him, because I disapproved of him from beginning to end.

▪ he must have felt that he had lost the old warm world, paid a high price for living too long with a single dream.

▪ So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.
When we can no longer rely on our coping mechanisms to help distract us from the problems in our lives, it can feel as though we’ve hit rock bottom. The reality is that this sort of awakening is what happens when we finally come to terms with the problems that have existed for a long time.

▪ The breakdown is often just the tipping point that precedes the breakthrough, the moment a star implodes before it becomes a supernova.

▪ human beings often need to be faced with no other option but to change before they really do.

▪ The fact that you are imperfect is not a sign that you have failed; it is a sign that you are human, and more importantly, it is a sign that you still have more potential within you.

▪ Usually when we have a problem that is circumstantial, we are facing the reality of life. When we have a problem that is chronic, we are facing the reality of ourselves.

▪ Your mountain is the block between you and the life you want to live. Facing it is also the only path to your freedom and becoming. You are here because a trigger showed you to your wound, and your wound will show you to your path, and your path will show you to your destiny.

▪ Your old self can no longer sustain the life you are trying to lead; it is time for reinvention and rebirth.

▪ You must release your old self into the fire of your vision and be willing to think in a way you have never even tried before

▪ the person who has gotten you this far but who is no longer equipped to carry you onward.

▪ One day, this mountain will be behind you, but who you become in the process of getting over it will stay with you always.

▪ self-sabotage is simply the presence of an unconscious need that is being fulfilled by the self-sabotaging behavior.

▪ Self-sabotage is what happens when we refuse to consciously meet our innermost needs, often because we do not believe we are capable of handling them.

▪ Sometimes, our most sabotaging behaviors are really the result of long-held and unexamined fears we have about the world and ourselves.

▪ If you were aware of the real issue, you could begin working to resolve it,

▪ Your life is defined not only by what you think about it, but also what you think of yourself.

▪ If your issue is that you want to be financially stable, and yet you keep ruining every effort you make to get there, you have to go back to your first concept of money. How did your parents manage their finances? More importantly, what did they tell you about people who had it and people who didn’t? Many people who struggle financially will justify their place in life by disavowing money as a whole. They will say that all rich people are terrible. If you grew up with people who told you your entire life that people who have money are this way, guess what you’re going to resist having?
...Human beings experience a natural resistance to the unknown, because it is essentially the ultimate loss of control.

▪ What you believe about your life is what you will make true about your life.

▪ To truly heal, you are going to have to change the way you think. You are going to have to become very conscious of negative and false beliefs and start shifting to a mindset that actually serves you.

▪ if you are here because you truly want to change your life, you are going to have to stop being in denial about your personal state of affairs. You are going to have to get real with yourself. You are going to have to decide that you love yourself too much to stop settling for less than what you really deserve.

▪ The greatest act of self-love is to no longer accept a life you are unhappy with. It is to be able to state the problem plainly and in a straightforward manner.

▪ Take a piece of paper and a pen, and write down everything you aren’t happy with. Write down, very specifically, every single problem y


ou face. If you are struggling with finances, you need a very clear picture of what’s wrong. Write down every debt, every bill, every asset, and every bit of income. If you are struggling with self-image, write down exactly what you dislike about yourself. If it is anxiety, write down everything that bothers or upsets you.

▪ Rock bottom is very often where we begin on our healing journey

▪ Rock bottom becomes a turning point because it is only at that point that most people think: I never want to feel this way again.

▪ In that moment, only one thing guides you, and it is this: No matter what it takes, I will never accept my life getting to this point again.

▪ Human beings are guided by comfort. They stay close to what feels familiar and reject what doesn’t, even if it’s objectively better for them.

▪ most people do not actually change their lives until not changing becomes the less comfortable option.

▪ If you really want to change your life, let yourself be consumed with rage: not toward others, not with the world, but within yourself.

▪ Get angry, determined, and allow yourself to develop tunnel vision with one thing and one thing only at the end: that you will not go on as you are.

▪ Your new life is going to cost you your old one.

▪ The people who are meant for you are going to meet you on the other side. You’re going to build a new comfort zone around the things that actually move you forward. Instead of being liked, you’re going to be loved. Instead of being understood, you’re going to be seen.

▪ All you’re going to lose is what was built for a person you no longer are.

▪ Self-sabotage is when you have two conflicting desires. One is conscious, one is unconscious. You know how you want to move your life forward, and yet you are still, for some reason, stuck.

▪ Perfectionism holds us back from showing up and trying, or really doing the important work of our lives.

▪ This happens because when we are afraid of failing, or feeling vulnerable, or not being as good as we want others to think we are, we end up avoiding the work that is required to actually become that good. We sabotage ourselves because it is the willingness to show up and simply do it, again and again and again, that ultimately brings us to a place of mastery.

...Don’t worry about doing it well; just do it.

▪ all that matters is that you do what you really want to do. From there, you can learn from your mistakes and over time get to the place where you really want to be.

▪ The truth is that we actually do not accomplish great feats when we are anxious about whether or not what we do will indeed be something impressive and world-changing

▪ We accomplish these sorts of things when we simply show up and allow ourselves to create something meaningful and important to us.

▪ Instead of perfection, focus on progress. Instead of having something done perfectly, focus on just getting it done. From there, you can edit, build, grow, and develop it to exactly what your vision is. But if you don’t get started, you’ll never arrive.

▪ When you are only able to process half of your emotions, you stunt yourself. You start going out of your way to avoid any possible situation that could bring up something frustrating or uncomfortable, because you have no tools to be able to handle that feeling. This means that you start avoiding the very risks and actions that would ultimately change your life for the better.

▪ Start measuring your outcomes and focusing on at least doing one productive thing each day.

▪ A clean, organized space—both for work and for living— is essential to thriving.

▪ It is very hard to show up as the person you want to be when you are surrounded by an environment that makes you feel like a person you aren’t.

▪ When we let go of what isn’t right for us, we create space to discover what is.

▪ When we set up judgments for others, they become rules that we have to play by, too. By judging others for what we don’t have or because we envy them, we sabotage our own lives far more than we ever really hurt anybody else.

▪ Practice non-j


udgment through non-assumption. Instead of reaching a conclusion about a person based on the limited information you have about them, consider that you’re not seeing the whole picture and don’t know the whole story.

▪ When you are more compassionate about other people’s lives, you become more compassionate about your own. When you see someone who has something you want, congratulate them, even if it feels hard at first. It will extend back and open you up to receiving it as well.

▪ How often do we not even attempt something because we are afraid to look bad or fail immediately?

▪ Instead of shrugging off a compliment, we can respond by saying: “Thank you, I worked very hard, and I’m happy to be here.”

figure out what makes you feel best. Decide what combination of healthy eating, exercise, and sleep is right for you, and stick to it.

▪ Gradually recondition yourself to prefer healthy habits, ones that actually work for your lifestyle.

▪ People who are constantly “busy” are running from themselves.

▪ This is because being “busy” is not a virtue; it only signals to others that you do not know how to manage your time or your tasks.

▪ Being busy is the ultimate way to distract ourselves from what’s really wrong.

▪ If your issue is that you intentionally create chaos and busyness in your day when there is no need for it, you have to get comfortable with simplicity and routine. Start with writing down your top 5 tasks that need to be done each day, and then focus on doing those and only those.

▪ You do, however, need to understand that the people you spend the most time with will shape your future irrevocably, and so you must choose them wisely.

▪ Instead of wasting all of your energy trying to control some worst-case scenario, consider what the message of the fear may be and what it is telling you that you need in your life.

▪ At the core of the things we most fear is a message that we are trying to send ourselves about what we really care about. If we can identify what we want to protect, we can find healthier and more secure ways to do it.

▪ Your willpower is a limited resource. You only have so much in a day. Rather than using it to try to become good at everything, decide what matters most to you. Focus your attention on that, and let everything else slip away.

▪ Give yourself credit for everything you’ve overcome that you never thought you would, and everything you’ve built that you never thought you could. You’ve come so much farther than you think, and you’re so much closer than you realize.

▪ If your subconscious core commitment is to be loved by others, your need is self-love.
THE MOST COMMON EMOTIONS

THAT ARISE WHILE YOU’RE BREAKING

SELF-SABOTAGING BEHAVIORS

▪ When you start to feel resistance, you don’t want to just “push through it.

▪ Instead, start asking the right questions.

▪ Why do I feel this way?

...What is this feeling trying to tell me about the action I am trying to take?

 

Is there something I need to learn here?

 

What do I need to do to honor my needs right now?

▪ Then you have to reconnect to your inspiration or your vision for life. Get clear on why you want to take this action and make a change. When your motivation is the fact that you want to live a different and better existence, you’re going to find that a lot of the resistance fades because you’re being pushed by a vision that’s greater than your fear.

▪ In other cases, you might run into other emotions such as anger, sadness, or inadequacy. When those feelings come up, it is very important to make space for them. This means to allow them to rise up in your body and observe them. Watch where they make you tense up or constrict. Feel what they want you to feel. There is nothing worse than the fear of feeling the emotion, as the experience itself is ultimately often just some physical tension around which we’ve crafted a story.

▪ Remember that a lot of these feelings may very well have a root in something related to the self-sabotaging behavior. If you are angry about how one of your parents treated you, it probab


ly won’t come as a surprise that the core feeling of why you are sabotaging your relationships is anger and mistrust. The feelings associated with self-sabotage are not usually random. In fact, they can lead us to deeper insights about what we really need and what problems within us are still unresolved.

▪ To fully release those feelings once you are aware of them, try writing yourself a letter. Write something to your younger self or from the perspective of your future self. Write down a mantra or a manifesto. Remind yourself that you love yourself too much to settle for less, or that it is okay to be angry in unfair or frustrating circumstances. Give yourself space to experience the depth of your emotions so that they do not control your behaviors.

▪ We are not held back in life because we are incapable of making change. We are held back because we don’t feel like making change, and so we don’t.

▪ The truth is that you can have a vision of what you want, know that it is undoubtedly right for you, and simply not feel like taking the action required to pursue that path.

▪ This is because our feelings are essentially wired as comfort systems. They produce a “good” feeling when we are doing what we have always done—staying in familiarity
This is how we restructure our comfort zones. We begin to crave what we repeatedly do, but the first few times we do it, we often feel uncomfortable. The trick is being able to override that initial hesitation so we are guiding our lives with logic and reason, not emotionality.

▪ It is essential that you learn to take action before you feel like doing it. Taking action builds momentum and creates motivation. These feelings will not come to you spontaneously; you have to generate them. You have to inspire yourself, you have to move. You have to simply begin and allow your life and your energy to reorient itself to prefer the behaviors that are going to move your life forward, not the ones that are keeping you held back.

▪ Each “negative” emotion we experience comes with a message, one that we do not yet know how to interpret. This is when a single challenge begins to become a chronic issue. Unable to honor and use the guidance of the emotion, we shut the feeling down, store it in our bodies, and try to avoid anything that might bring it up again. This is when we become sensitive to the world around us, because there are a lot of repressed feelings mounting.
