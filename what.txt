Our first loves will always be our parents, caregivers, and siblings, and the first model of romantic love will be the relationship our parents or caregivers had with each other. The affection and care they did or didn’t show significantly affects the way we experience intimacy, love, and relationships today.

While media and dating folklore greatly shapes the ways we think about love, there’s no denying that how we’re raised also greatly changes the way we experience love as adults. When your ability to bond with your parents or caregivers is disrupted, so is your entire sense of healthy, secure love.

The kind of love that your parents or caregivers showed for each other becomes your first example of how romantic relationships function. Unless someone drastically intervenes to change that narrative (or you do it yourself), you’ll most likely grow up to act the same way in your relationships as your parents did.

Anxious people (I’m one of them) tend to be the clingy, fearful type. We worry our partner will cheat or leave us at any moment. Over-thinking is our specialty.

The truth is, the best kind of relationship is where two people having thriving lives outside of their relationship. Whether that looks like working hard at your career, seeing your friends every week, or pursuing your passions intensely, independence should be celebrated. If someone is scared off by your happiness in life, then good riddance.

Don’t automatically buy into the notion you’ll work through all the bad times; that’s only perpetuating that idea the other person can mistreat you. Sometimes, standing by your partner will put you in the way of danger. Those are the times you need to leave.<BR>

Figuring out what you’re feeling can help you cool down in situations where you feel overwhelmed. For me, saying things out loud like, “I’m feeling hurt because I trusted my ex,” helped during the worst parts of my breakups.

Having been through several good and bad relationships since then, I know now that love isn’t something you can force on anyone. It will come in its own time. While that can be a hurtful truth sometimes, it’s a magical one at other times.

You can’t imagine what will make you happy until you experience it. Your mind can only think in terms of things you’ve already experienced; like what happened in your past, who you’ve dated, and what you’ve watched in the media. All of that combined creates the idea we have from a young age of what kind of love would fulfill us.

Everyone, including you and me, deserves extraordinary love that surpasses the small idea we created when we were younger about how love should look. Someone who respects and cherishes you. Someone who’s not only your partner but your equal. You deserve to stop chasing love. You deserve to have love come naturally, when it’s meant to happen.<BR>

Start journaling. Take yourself on dates. Splurge on your favorite meal. Spend a little extra so you can enjoy your favorite chocolates. Buy yourself the damn flowers. Don’t wait around for someone else to give you what you can give yourself.

And take care of your needs along the way. Celebrate every accomplishment you achieve, even the small ones (I cannot emphasize enough that you need to enjoy the small wins). Whisper kind words to yourself whenever you come across your reflection in the mirror. Learn every little thing about who you are as a unique person on this planet; what clothes feel best on your body, which foods ignite your taste buds, and what you value most in life.

If this world needs more of anything, it’s for people to create. Whatever it is you love to do—painting, music, writing, cooking—do those instead of worrying over unreturned texts or mixed signals from someone who doesn’t reciprocate your affection.

I’m sure if you were honest with yourself, you’d say you’re exhausted from trying to chase the idea of love. It’s like baking homemade cookies: you have better things to do with your Sunday afternoon than chase someone for their cookies, especially when you can make your own and feel proud when they’re done.

But poor relationships over the years may have buried who you are under layers of insecurities, false beliefs, and criticism. You might feel that, in this exact moment, you can’t remember who you were before other people hurt you, which may be as far back as your childhood. But I’m here to say, your true self is still deep inside you, and it’s most likely evolved over the years. Only you can uncover and bring those parts of yourself back to light. Sure, you may have collected a few scars along the way that are also part of who you are today, but don’t worry; there’s not a single person in this world who doesn’t have several scars of their own.

The people who are out in the world, leading a positive life filled with their passions, won’t be attracted to others who aren’t doing the same. And, on the flip side, when you’re unhappy, you’re more likely to attract other unhappy people into your life.

Pursuing interests, activities, and people who make you feel full, rather than drain you, radiates loving energy into your life. You start to enjoy the way you spend your downtime. You might realize working eight hours a day at a job you don’t like isn’t for you. You invest your time into people who care about and cherish your presence. Living a life like this, in turn, makes you someone who people want to be around because you’re radiating the love everyone craves more of in their life. One day, without even realizing it, you’ll look around and see how your zest for living attracted more love into your life without you even trying.

Letting go of friendships can be one of the hardest things to do. When you’ve known someone for a long time, you might feel obligated to keep them in your life. But the reality is, not everyone is meant to be in your life forever. People come and go. You need to look out for your mental health first.

But studies have shown that having an open, inviting body posture increases a person’s confidence. Standing tall, with your shoulders back and a smile on your face will make you feel like you’re more in control of situations. Of course, do what feels natural but be aware that we often use body language as a way for our insecurities to be expressed.

Vulnerability starts with being vulnerable with yourself. How can you step into a life of courage if you’re afraid to acknowledge all of you? The memories that hurt, the parts you’re not proud of, your faults, your insecurities. Until you’re able to look in the mirror and confront everything, you won’t be able to experience true vulnerability with others.”<BR>

Healthy relationships are between two people who can fix issues and grow together; not people who get along perfectly.

You always hear people say, “nothing great comes easy,” and the same goes for love: it’ll be hard sometimes. You should feel respected and cherished, but love means compromising on whose family you spend Christmas with. It means arguments and talking about difficult feelings, like how you spend your money. It’s admitting you’re wrong and also learning to forgive when your partner accidentally hurts you. Love is something you work on, and the reward is wholly worth it; having a person to enjoy the smallest moments in life is worth the work.

“There will come a time in your life where you need to question the beliefs you unconsciously picked up throughout life if you want to grow. You’ll have to decide whether or not they serve you anymore based on where you want to be with your life. Because everyone is given beliefs about how to live, but that doesn’t mean you need to keep them, especially when they’re holding you back.”

When someone takes the time to have a serious conversation with you, whether that be an argument or discussion, that’s a sign they care on some level. They’re not just in it for the fun emotions; they want to work through the serious ones, too.

Love is respecting your partner’s life even when you’re not involved. It’s knowing you’re both individuals with differences that are respected. You don’t belong to each other; instead, you choose to be with each other. And this free will in love is part of what makes it beautiful.

“Let your reaction to their inaction guide you into understanding more about yourself. Ask why you’re willing to invest energy into someone who invests so little of theirs into you. Ask yourself what belief you hold that makes you think you don’t deserve better.”

Dating patterns exist subconsciously as beliefs and habits we collect over our lifetime: they come from experiences, our childhood, what we see in the media and other external sources.

<BR>Don’t play games. A relationship is like a house: you want to build on a solid foundation. Don’t begin a relationship with someone who waits to text you back or goes silent for days. This isn’t checkers, it’s your love life.

Be forward about your intentions. If the other person is turned off, then consider their reaction a blessing. You don’t want to spend your precious time with someone who doesn’t want the same things for the relationship as you.

Couples who argue hash out issues rather than bottling them up. They learn more about each other and create healthy compromises. But most importantly, they care enough about the relationship to have conversations that are uncomfortable.

There’s nothing wrong with needing time to collect yourself, breathe, and think about things. But if you don’t voice that need to your partner, it’s unfair to them. When you suddenly walk away from your partner and ignore them, it’s disrespectful and confusing to them.

If you know you’re the type of person who needs to cool down, simply say to your partner, “I’m feeling very upset about this argument. Can we revisit this conversation later today at dinner?” That way you’ve voiced what you’re experiencing and acknowledged you’ll talk about things at another time.
