Quote
"ANGER. It is healthy to be angry, and anger can also show us important aspects of who we are and what we care about. For example, anger shows us where our boundaries are. Anger also helps us identify what we find to be unjust."
"Sadness is the normal and correct response to the loss of something you very much love. Sadness only becomes problematic when we do not allow ourselves to go through the natural phases of grief. Sadness does not release itself all at once. In fact, we often find that it happens in waves, some of which strike us at unexpected times."
"Jealousy is a cover-up emotion. It presents as anger or judgment, when in reality it is sadness and self-dissatisfaction. If you want to know what you truly want out of life, look at the people who you are jealous of. No, you may not want exactly what they have, but the feeling that you are experiencing is anger that they are allowing themselves to pursue it while you are not. When we use our jealousy to show us what we would like to accomplish, we begin to recognize the self-sabotaging behavior and get ready to commit to what we actually desire. You can think of it this way: When we see someone who has something we really want but we are suppressing our willingness to pursue it, we must also condemn it in them so we can justify our own course of action. Instead of this, we can see what we’d also like to create."
"When we resent people, it is often because they did not live up to the expectation of them that we had in our minds. Resentment in some ways is like a projected regret. Instead of trying to show us what we should change, it seems to want to tell us what other people should change. However, other people are under no obligation to live up to our ideas of them. In fact, our only problem is that we have an unrealistic expectation that someone was meant to be exactly as we think they should or love us exactly as we imagined they would."
"Other people are not here to love us perfectly; they are here to teach us lessons to show us how to love them—and ourselves—better."
"When we release the ideas we have about who they should be, we can see them for who they are and the role they are meant to play in our lives. Instead of focusing on how they should change, we can focus instead on what we can learn."
"gret is also another way that we show ourselves not what we wish we could have done in the past, but what we absolutely need to create going forward. Regret isn’t actually trying to just make us feel bad that we didn’t live up to our own expectations. It is trying to motivate us to live up to them going forward. It is trying to show us what it is absolutely imperative to change in the future and what we really care about experiencing before we die."
"The truth is that when we stop being afraid of what we cannot control and know instead that nothing can possibly ruin our lives more than we are ruining them with our negative, distracted, and irrational thinking and focus, we are completely freed."
"The things that are bothering you most right now are not external forces trying to torture you for the sake of it— they are your own mind identifying what in your life can be fixed, changed, and transformed. If you continue to not take action, the siren will only get louder, and if you never learn to listen to it, you will probably just disassociate from it and then be a victim to it."
"You already have the answers. You already know what you’re here to do. You are here to create everything that would make you happier than you can imagine. It is only a matter of quieting your mind enough so you can feel all of the unlimited potential that is begging you to be used."
"Pushing people away. WHAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MIGHT WANT YOU TO KNOW: You want people to love and accept you so much that the stress of it all makes you isolate yourself from the pain, effectively creating the reality you’re trying to avoid. Alternatively, needing solitude too often usually means there is a discrepancy between who you pretend to be and who you actually are. When you show up to your life more authentically, it becomes easier to have people around you, as it requires less effort."
"Not doing the work you know would help move your career forward. WHAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MIGHT WANT YOU TO KNOW: You might not be as clear as you think you are on what you want to be doing. If it isn’t flowing, there is a reason. Instead of trying to push through and continually hitting the same wall over and over again, take a step back. Maybe it’s time to regroup, restrategize, or seriously think about why you’re trying to take the steps you are. Something needs to change, and it’s probably not just your motivation."
"You do not have to prove your value. You do, however, have to stop running from the discomfort of being alone with your feelings, which is very often the reason that people overwork. There is a difference between being passionately committed to something and feeling obligated to outperform everyone else. One is healthy; the other is not."
"THE WAY YOU ARE SELF-SABOTAGING: Caring too much about what other people think. WHAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MIGHT WANT YOU TO KNOW: You are not as happy as you think you are. The happier you are with something, the less you need other people to be. Instead of wondering whether or not someone else will think you are enough, stop and ask yourself: Is my life enough for me? How do you really feel about your life when you aren’t looking at it through the eyes of others?"
"THE WAY YOU ARE SELF-SABOTAGING: Dwelling on past relationships or continually checking up on exes. WHAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MIGHT WANT YOU TO KNOW: This relationship affected you more than you are letting yourself believe. The ending hurt you more than you acknowledged, and you need to process that. Your continued interest in this person means there’s something about the relationship that is still unresolved, and it is probably some kind of closure or acceptance that you need to find for yourself."
"THE WAY YOU ARE SELF-SABOTAGING: Not promoting your work in a way that would help move you forward. WHAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MIGHT WANT YOU TO KNOW: You’re not creating the best possible work you can, and you sense it. The reason why you’re holding back is a fear of judgment, but that wouldn’t exist if you weren’t already judging yourself. You have to create things you are proud to share, and when sharing them in a positive way that helps grow your business or career feels natural and authentic, you will know that you are doing the work that is at the best of your ability or potential."
"THE WAY YOU ARE SELF-SABOTAGING: Ascribing intent or worrying that things are about you when they aren’t. WHAT YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND MIGHT WANT YOU TO KNOW: You think about yourself too often. Other people’s lives do not revolve around you, nor do their thoughts. They are busy thinking about themselves in the same way that you are thinking about yourself. Remember that patterns in your life are indicative of your own behaviors, but imagining that every time someone cuts you off in traffic is a personal attack, you’re going to severely hold yourself back, because you’ll always be the victim of something."
"You are in the situation you are in now because you did not know how to understand or meet your needs in the moment."
"“gut instinct” can only respond to what’s happening in the present. If you have an “instinct” about a future event, you’re projecting."
"If you find yourself particularly drained after spending time with someone or are feeling like you don’t want to see them again, that’s your instinct."
"You have to remember that your feelings, while valid, are not often real. They are not always accurate reflections of reality. They are, however, always accurate reflections of our thoughts. Our thoughts change our feelings."
"You begin experiencing feelings of peace and joy in your life when you condition yourself to take repeated daily actions that facilitate clarity, calmness, healthfulness, and purposefulness, not the other way around."
"When you have a “gut instinct” about someone, it is after interacting with them. When you know whether or not a job is right for you, it is only after having done it for a while."
"First and foremost, understand that your instinct can serve you immensely in the present moment. Your first reaction to something is very often the wisest reaction, because your body is using all of the subconscious information you have logged away to inform you about something before your brain has an opportunity to second-guess it. Overall, your honest gut instinct won’t ever frighten you into panic. Your gut is always subtle and gentle, even if it’s telling you that something isn’t for you. If your gut wants you to know not to see someone or to stop engaging in a relationship or behavior, the impulse will be quiet. That’s why it’s called the “little voice” within. So easy to miss. So easy to shout over."
"Understanding your needs, meeting the ones you are responsible for, and then allowing yourself to show up so others can meet the ones you can’t do on your own will help you break the self-sabotage cycle and build a healthier, more balanced and fulfilling life."
"when we get something we really want, we just start to want more. So the big, huge goal that you’re working toward? You’ll get there, and then there will be another mountain to scale."
"What you do every single day accounts for the quality of your life and the degree of your success. It’s not whether you “feel” like putting in the work, but whether or not you do it regardless."
"Making big, sweeping changes is not difficult because we are flawed, incompetent beings. It’s difficult because we are not meant to live outside of our comfort zones."
"You don’t need to wait until you feel like changing to start changing. All you need is to make one microshift at a time and then let the energy and momentum build."
"The cultural obsession with chasing happiness, shielding oneself from anything triggering, and the idea that life is primarily “good” and any challenge we face is a mistake of fate are what actually weaken us mentally."
"The truth about your psyche is this: Anything that is new, even if it is good, will feel uncomfortable until it is also familiar."
"Overall, it comes down to the simple fact that any accomplishments, achievements, or life changes, no matter how positive, elicit change. Change elicits stress. This is particularly true for those who are already predisposed to anxiety and depression, because the concept of one’s comfort zone is absolutely essential to stabilizing their mood. This is also why those people can often seem overwhelmingly particular or narrow-minded."
"If we are no longer worried about basic survival, our minds are free to turn to the bigger questions in life: What is our purpose? Have we lived meaningfully? Are we who we want to be?"
"Your big life change is going to force you to level up in every way imaginable, and the way to overcome the initial fear of stepping into the unknown is to familiarize yourself with it, to make it a part of you, one that you are certain you are prepared for—and that you deserve."
"“This moment is not my life. It is a moment in my life.”"
"Everyone thinks that the world revolves around them. You are thinking about you and your own interests all day, every day. It can be challenging to forget that others are not thinking about us with such intensity; they are thinking about themselves."
"Instead of trying to use your intelligence to hack what’s next, try to get better at where you are currently. That’s what’s really going to change the outcomes of your life."
"gth is not just hoping that nothing ever goes wrong. It is believing that we have the capacity to handle it if it does."
"A faulty inference is when you come up with a false conclusion based on valid evidence."
"work on developing your self-esteem and know that even if you were to fail, you wouldn’t be judged, exiled, or hated in the way you fear."
"You cannot force yourself to let go, no matter how much you know you want to."
"You start to let go on the day you take one step toward building a new life and then let yourself lie in bed and stare at the ceiling and cry for as many hours as you need.You start to let go on the day you realize that you cannot continue to revolve around a missing gap in your life, and going on as you were before will simply not be an option."
"You start to let go at the moment you realize that this is the impetus, this is the catalyst, this is that moment the movies are made about and the books are written around and songs are inspired by."
"This is the moment you realize that you will never find peace standing in the ruins of what you used to be."
"You can only move on if you start building something new. You let go when you build a new life so immersive and engaging and exciting, you slowly, over time, forget about the past."
"When we try to force ourselves to “let go” of something, we grip onto it tighter, and harder, and more passionately than ever before. It’s like if someone tells you to not think of a white elephant, that’s the only thing you’ll be able to focus on. As long as we are telling ourselves that we must let go, the more deeply we feel attached."
"What you build in the wake and the aftermath of loss will be so profound, so stunning, you will realize that maybe the loss was part of the plan. Maybe it awakened a part of you that would have remained dormant had you not been pushed the way you were."
"If you are certain that you cannot let go of what is hurting you, then don’t, But take one step today, and another tomorrow, to rebuild a new life for yourself. Piece by piece, day by day."
"Because sooner or later, you’re going to go an hour and realize you didn’t think about them or it. Then a day, then a week…and then years and swaths of your life drift by and everything you thought would break you becomes a distant memory, something you look back at and smile."
"Everything you lose becomes something you are profoundly grateful for. With time, you see that it was not the path. It was what was standing in your way."
"We weren’t broken by a breakup; we were broken by wanting love that wasn’t right for us. We weren’t devastated by a loss; we were devastated because we wanted, so badly, for that person or thing to remain in our lives."
"If you truly want to let go of a past experience, you have to reenter it through your memory. Close your eyes and find the feeling in your body that is uncomfortable."
"The truth is that when we are unhealthily attached to something in the past, our perspective of it is often distorted. We aren’t seeing reality for what it was, and we need to assist ourselves in being able to broaden our mindset and open up to the truth."
"The wildest thing about life is how unassumingly it keeps moving. You lose the person closest to you and the world affords you a few days of grieving, and then you’re expected to just keep going. You go through something so life-shifting, mind-altering, and deeply traumatic, then find that society only has a small bandwidth for tolerating your fear."
"But processing and accepting the gravity of something that touched every last inch of you is not something you can do on a mental-health day. It’s not something the world affords you enough time for, and so you botch the job. You carry on."
"One day, you wake up and discover that by every identifiable measure, you have moved on. You’re so many miles from where you started, you can’t even remember it clearly. What you’re underestimating is the fact that though you can leave a place, or a person, or a situation…you can’t leave yourself."
"When your mind is stuck in the past, it isn’t because it wants to return there; it’s because you were impacted far more deeply than you ever realized, and the aftershocks are still rippling through you. That younger self doesn’t just want you to keep walking; it wants you to turn around and acknowledge it."
"You are not wrong or broken for feeling the way that you do. You responded to your circumstances as any healthy person would have. If anyone else was in your shoes, they would have reacted the exact same way. They would feel the exact same way."
"You were a healthy person who went through something traumatic and responded accordingly."
"You change your life when you start showing up exactly as you are. You change your life when you become comfortable with being happy here, even if you want to go forward."
"You change your life when you can love yourself even though you don’t look exactly the way you want to."
"We must be brave and confront our discomfort, sit with it even if it churns our stomachs and pinches our faces and makes us certain we will never find a way out. (We will.)"
"When you start showing up as exactly who you are, you start radically changing your life.You start receiving authentic love. You start doing your best and most profitable and effortless work. You start laughing; you start enjoying things again. You start realizing that you just needed anything to project all this fear onto, so you chose the most vulnerable and common issues in life."
"When you start showing up exactly as you are, you cut the bullshit."
"There is nothing that you can do to win someone or something that is not meant to be yours."
"What isn’t right for you will never remain in your life."
"when something is right for you, it brings you clarity, and when something is wrong for you, it brings you confusion."
"The truth is that what is not right for you will never remain with you. Though you might want to pretend that you don’t know if this is the case, you do. You can feel it. It’s why you have to grip so hard and with so little give. The things that are right for you can be free from you. You don’t have to convince them that they are right. You don’t have to line up the evidence as though you’re pleading your case."
"What is not right for you will not remain with you because deep down, you know it’s not right. You are the one who eventually lets go, sees reality, and walks away. You are the one resisting, you are the one holding back, you are the one concocting healing fantasies about how great it will be when you force something wrong to finally be right."
"Trauma is what happens when something scares you and you do not get over that fear. If you do not resolve or “defeat” it, you get into, and remain in, a sustained state of fight-or-flight, which is essentially the human panic response for survival."
"Your trauma is not “in your head”; it is literally a changed state in your brain, and the only way you will help your body to return to its actual state is by recreating the feeling of safety that allows you to “turn off ” survival mode and return to normal life."
"The truth is that our bodies are speaking to us in voiceless symbols. If we can learn to interpret what they are saying, we can heal ourselves in an entirely new way."
"STOP MEDITATING TO FEEL CALM; START MEDITATION TO JUST FEEL."
"xperience all of those feelings come up: the rage, the fear, the sadness, the overwhelming mind chatter…and in spite of how alluring or triggering it may be, you learn to stay still and not respond to it. You learn to allow these thoughts and feelings to come up and then pass by virtue of you not reacting to them."
"Healing yourself is the most uncomfortable, disruptive, important thing you will ever do."
"When you are no longer scared to feel anything, when you no longer resist any one part of your life, something magical happens: You find peace."
"You realize that nothing will save you, and so you must begin the work of saving yourself, which is the entire purpose of your life."
"MOVING FORWARD ISN’T ABOUT GETTING REVENGE"
"In a world of revenge bodies and comeback relationships, a world that tries to tell you that your ultimate transformation should be splayed out across your Instagram feed, we’ve lost what it really means to heal, to improve, to move on with our lives. The real glow up isn’t proving the people from your past wrong. It is finally feeling so content and hopeful about your future that you stop thinking about them entirely. When you want to change your life so it looks different, and only that, you are still orbiting around the opinions of people who didn’t love you and didn’t have any intention to. Anyone can piece together an image that looks better. Anyone can edit and filter and lay picture after picture, side by side, to create a narrative, a story, a semblance of the whole. Anyone can buy their way into beauty, anyone can look nicer if they really try, anyone can convince you that they are doing better than they really are. What if you were more concerned about whether or not you gain self-res pect, real relationships, emotional freedom, mental clarity, a job you appreciate, work you respect, a kinder and more empathetic disposition? What if your accomplishments were not something you could photograph or measure, nothing you could loosely try to communicate across some pixels and status updates? How are you feeling today? Better than you did yesterday? More whole, more confident? Nobody is looking at you the way you think they are. Nobody is thinking about you the way you wish they would. They are looking at themselves. They are thinking about themselves.The truth is that you have nobody to prove wrong but yourself. The people from your past probably didn’t disapprove of you nearly as much as you feared they did. So remember this: The next time you’re trying to craft a glow up story that is compelling to others, ask yourself why you are still waiting for their approval. The answer, almost always, is that you still do not have your own."
"The process is akin to reverse engineering, which is when you identify the end goals for your life and then work backwards to see what you need to do each day, week, month, and year to get there. However, it works the opposite way as well. You can use a visualization technique to connect to your highest potential future self."
"If you are traumatized about relationships, you need to build healthy relationships. If you are traumatized about money, you need to get really good with money. If you are traumatized about traveling, you need to travel again. We do not find the resolution in avoiding these things forever. In fact, just underneath the fear we often find that they are the things we really want more than anything else."
"The first step to becoming your most powerful self is to literally envision that person."
"What would the most powerful version of me do right now? What would they do with this day? How would they respond to this challenge? How would they move forward? How would they think? What would they feel?"
"Your most powerful self needs to be the CEO of your life. Once you have a clearer image of what your most powerful self is like, you then need to evaluate what habits, traits, and behaviors are actively holding you back from fully embodying that person."
"The ability to say to yourself: “I know I struggle a lot with this, so I’m going to take my time and work on it” is one of the most powerful things you can do."
"To be a truly powerful person, you must be willing to be disliked."
"Your purpose is a dynamic, evolving thing. Most of the time, it is at the intersection of what you are interested in, what you are good at, and what the world needs."
"To do your inner work means to evaluate why something triggered you, why something is upsetting you, what your life is trying to show you, and the ways you could grow from these experiences"
"work on simplifying your life, talking less about your ambitions, and showing more of your accomplishments once they are completed."
"Assume that everyone, and everything, has something to teach you."
"Validating someone’s feelings doesn’t mean you agree with them. It doesn’t mean you concede that they are correct. It doesn’t mean that those feelings are the healthiest; it doesn’t mean they are informed by logic. Validating feelings does not mean you make them more true; it means you remind someone that it is human to feel things they don’t always understand."
"I am so sorry for what you are going through."
"You often don’t experience the consequences of your actions immediately, which can be deceiving."
"Little things, done repeatedly and over time, become the big things."
"Perhaps you value financial freedom, and so by principle, you are going to put your extra cash toward repaying debt or building savings or investments. Perhaps you value travel and freedom, and so by principle, you are going to start working for yourself and always prioritize being able to work remotely or make your own schedule."
"When you are clear on what your principles are, you can build your life from a genuine, healthy place. You can start working toward goals that support what you do and do not want to experience, that will make you the calmest and happiest version of yourself."
"The most important thing you can do to live meaningfully is to work on yourself. To consciously become the happiest, kindest, and most gracious version of yourself."
"Your life purpose is the point at which your skills, interests, and the market intersect."
"You are the blueprint of your future. Everything that you are, everything that you have experienced, everything that you’re good at, every circumstance you have found yourself in, everything that you’re passionate about is not random; it’s a reflection of who you are and a sign about what you are here to do."
"Inner peace is the state of being connected to the deep internal knowing that everything is okay and always will be."
"In the midst of winter, I found there was, within me, an invincible summer.”"
": the understanding that no matter what is happening around you, there is a place of total knowing and calmness within you. Not only are you capable of returning to that place when you need to, but it’s possible to live your entire life from there."
"You know when people reference knowing something “deep down?” They say things like: “I’m worried, but deep down, I know it’s going to be okay.” Or, “I’m angry at him, but deep down, I know he loves me.” What do you think they are referencing? Where is deep down? They’re talking about the place within them that has an infinite wisdom, a better understanding, and a more insightful perspective of what’s going on. It isn’t shaken by the stressors or fears that the mind wants to offer."
"So much of the process of finding inner peace is being able to get to that “deep down” place where you know and feel that ultimately everything will be okay."
"The reality is that inner peace is the true happiness, and everything else is just a false means of trying to convince yourself that you are “okay.”"
"worries are a fabrication of your mind’s need to identify potential threats for survival, and true happiness is being here in the moment."
"Your response to the second will also be relieving, because it will show you just how much pain you thought was insurmountable in your life and how, in retrospect, you don’t really ever think about those things anymore."
"gs being perfect on the outside, but from you being present and open and connected to yourself and to the moment."
"wants to constantly seek out situations and experiences that will affirm itself. If you believe something will be good, it will be. It might not look exactly how you imagined, but the outcome will be exactly what you expect."
"Think about something you aren’t scared of. Do you know why you aren’t scared of it? Because you have a plan for what you’d do if it were to happen. So you’re able to let go and be present."
"Whether it’s becoming financially healthy, improving your relationships, going to therapy, getting a new job, or pursuing a new career path or dream: If you don’t have a plan, you’re going to keep having a problem."
"ASK FOR HELP, BECAUSE YOU’RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KNOW EVERYTHING"
"People go to school; they apprentice and train to become very skilled at one task. They then market and sell this task in exchange for purchasing other people’s expertise."
"what you are proficient in. Outsource everything else."
"Stop trying to predict what you can’t know, and start putting your energy toward building what you can. You and your life will be better for it."
"Reflect on what went wrong, learn from what went wrong, and figure out how you’re either going to make up for it or change the outcome in the future. Then let it go."
"If we can see these triggers as signals that are trying to help us put our attention toward some part of our lives that needs healing, health, and progress, we can begin to see them as helpful instead of hurtful."
"If you can begin to see your life as a feedback mechanism that is reflecting who you are with the ultimate goal to help you live better and more fully, all of a sudden you realize that it was never the world standing in your way, but your own mind."
"True happiness is embracing the little joys in life: the sunrise on a warm summer morning, your cup of coffee, or an amazing book. It is being grateful not only for when big things happen, but also for the small satisfactions that you can find every day."
"Real joy is finding happiness where you are and how you are."
"When you meet someone with whom you really have a connection, go out of your way to make sure you see that person and keep your friendship healthy."
"Think of life as something you can constantly learn from. Your pain teaches you what does not feel good and what you should not continue to do. Your joy teaches you what is in alignment. Everything can be your teacher, and the more you allow your life experiences to shift and change you, the better you (and they) will become."
"You cannot avoid all pain, but you can absolutely avoid a lot of suffering by staying focused on your internal growth."
"BE AWARE OF WHAT YOU GIVE YOUR ENERGY TO"
"When you give your energy to certain thoughts, they gain life. There’s a saying that the wolf that wins is the one that you feed,"
"when it comes to the quality of your life, you need to be extremely careful of what you allow yourself to think. It will soon become what you feel, then what you believe, and then how you behave, and sure enough, the way you live."
"If you really want to enjoy life, you have to make time to do what you loved when you were young."
"When you look back on your life, you won’t remember the hardships. You’ll see them then as pivot points, growth opportunities, the days of awakening right before everything changed."
"A true master knows that it is not what happens, but the way one responds, that determines the outcome."
"When you reach the peak of it all—whatever that may be for you—you will look back and know that every step was worth it. More than anything, you will be overwhelmingly grateful for the pain that led you to begin your journey, because really, it wasn’t trying to hurt you as much as it was trying to show you that something was wrong. That something was the risk of your potential remaining untapped, your life spent with the wrong people, doing the wrong things, and wondering why you never felt quite right."
"One day, the mountain that was in front of you will be so far behind you, it will barely be visible in the distance. But who you become in learning to climb it? That will stay with you forever. That is the point of the mountain."
"Learn to like what doesn’t cost much. Those are the things worth your time."
"It’s interesting to think about how we make people who used to be everything into nothing again. How we learn to forget. How we force forgetting. What we put in place of them in the interim."
"All things are ultimately designed to serve us. All things are good."
"Ross says had to know defeat and suffering and struggle to know appreciation and sensitivity and understanding."
"grief is a faster teacher than joy"
"what really gives us a feeling of well-being. It’s the very inherent sense that everything’s going to be all right, because we are capable of making it all right. “[Self-esteem is knowing] that we can determine our own course and that we can travel that course. It’s not that we travel the course alone, but we need the feeling of agency—that if everything were to fall apart, we could find a way to put things back together again.”"
"Your goals are perfect outcomes, not perfect actions. You’re more in love with ideas than you are with work and processes required to make them reality. When you dream up your perfect life, you think about how you’re seen, rather than what your daily tasks include."
"The fact that sometimes, the ultimate expression of self-love is admitting you don’t like yourself and coming up with steps to change the things that you know you can and will do better."
"You either see yourself as a victim of what happens to you, or as someone given opportunity to change, grow, see differently, and expand."
"We take past emotions and project them onto situations that are in our current lives. This is to say, unless we heal what happened in the past, we’re always going to be controlled by it."
"To be truly fulfilled is to be happy because of your own self-realization. It is to come to such a genuine understanding of what you want that not doing it isn’t an option anymore."
"You can be more alone in a crowded room and feel more connected in complete solitude."
"Because letting go has little to do with giving somebody permission to leave our lives, or declare that they don’t love us anymore, or walk away for good, and everything to do with accepting that they already have."
"There are always those bits that linger."
"When we think there is a purpose for our pain, the discomfort of it dissolves. It turns from an annoyance to an opportunity. Our suffering ceases."
"Learn to keep your needs simple and your wants small."
"I don’t know about fate. But I do know the things that are ours don’t require us to mentally and emotionally latch onto them to remain. That the best things are never forced, are never created out of ultimatums, never leave us reeling and questioning them for months or years at a time."
"Little by little."
"But you are not going to be ready for the love of your life when they show up. Nobody is. And if you deny yourself that relationship because you think you need to do more work beforehand, what you’re really doing is missing out on the most effective growing tool there is."
"The things in the past that you thought you’d never get over, and how insignificant they seem today."
"was crucial to the process, the things that were lost to prepare for those that would be gained, the excruciating experiences that made you who you are now."
"Success is falling in love with the process, not the outcome."
"There is no way you will be able to predict or plan what will be happening in 5 years from now."
"Make time for the friends you have more than you seek out the ones you don’t. Stop counting how many people are in your life as though hitting a certain tally will make you feel loved. Start appreciating how rare and beautiful it is to even just have one close friend in life. Not everybody is so lucky."
"You believe that creating your best life is a matter of deciding what you want and then going after it, but in reality, you are psychologically incapable1 of being able to predict what will make you happy."
"They don’t assume that the way they think and feel about a situation is the way it is in reality, nor how it will turn out in the end."
"The only way you grow is by stepping into the unknown. It’s why so many people have “breakdown before breakthrough” moments. Often, their lives are leading them to better possibilities than they thought possible; they just didn’t know it was “good” at the time."
"Love is a grand magnifier: It shows you what you love and what you dislike about yourself and your life. The right relationship will encourage you to address that fully and work on it. The right relationship will help you learn to love yourself. It is meant to change everything, and it always does."
"whatever you feel in the moment"
"Your brain can only perceive what it’s known, so when you choose what you want for the future, you’re actually just recreating a solution or an ideal of the past."
"The problem is not the presence of pain. It’s the inability to see the purpose of it."
"They recognize their emotions as responses, not accurate gauges, of what’s going on. They accept that those responses may have to do with their own issues, rather than the objective situation at hand."
"We believe that “happiness” is the sustained state of feeling “good.” It is because of this belief that we are not happy. Happy people are not people who “feel good” all the time; they are the people who are able to be guided by their negative emotions rather than paralyzed by them."
"And I do know that it’s never the love that hurts you, it’s the attachment to the idea of what it’s supposed to be."
"As the Stoics practiced negative visualization (imagining the worst possible outcomes and then preparing for them),"
"The second you realize you can define what “good” is in your life is the second you can start to free yourself."
"I do know that we will never be able to find real love unless we learn to detach from what it should be."
"I want to believe that you either love someone, in some way, forever, or you never really loved them at all. That once two reactive chemicals cross, both are changed. That the wounds we leave in people are sometimes too raw to risk falling back into them. I don’t want to believe that we write each other off because we simply don’t matter anymore. I know love isn’t expendable. I wonder, and maybe hope, if we ever just force it to be out of necessity."
"w that moving on isn’t a conscious choice, but rather what happens when you stop trying to. When you stop forcing yourself to forget. You forget about them when you start thinking about you."
"Practice negative visualization. Create tangible solutions for your intangible fears. Show yourself that you won’t actually die if you lose a job or a boyfriend. Make a list of the things you worry about most, imagine the worst outcome, then make a plan for exactly how you would deal with it if that came to pass."
"Their emotions aren’t “somebody else’s doing,” and therefore “somebody else’s problem to resolve.”"
"You are unaware of the fact that love is nothing but an enhancement."
"It magnifies and brings clarity to whatever is most present in your life. So if the things that are most present are self-doubt, lostness, insecurity, etc., you will only have more and more of that."
"And if you don’t consciously decide what matters and what doesn’t, you’ll spend the rest of your life in feeling patterns, responding to what you were conditioned by when you were young."
"You’re not the same person you were a year ago. You’re learning, and evolving, and can identify the ways in which you’ve changed for better and worse."
"It’s a rare thing to love somebody unconditionally. The very basis of love is finding someone who fills a set of preconceived conditions."
"Living in the moment isn’t a lofty ideal reserved for the Zen and enlightened; it’s the only way to live a life that isn’t infiltrated with illusions. It’s the only thing your brain can actually comprehend"
"You’re always busy, yet never productive enough. Your work never seems to be done, you lose hours and don’t know where they’ve gone, you’re always stressed and frizzling-out your brain, as though you’re perpetually in the middle of a high-intensity task that never sees completion."
"It’s why “loving yourself first” is the most common, the most confusing, and yet the most profoundly solid advice anyone can give. Because it’s not really about feeling love for yourself; it’s being able to feel stable enough that your mindset doesn’t rest in the narrative of a supposed other’s."
"The minute you start thinking of the past or future, realize that it’s only a thought of a thing, a thought that’s happening in a now. A now that we’re missing."
"Our big loves are the loves that emerge after we think we’ve lost them already. They come after we’re ready, after we’ve already cleared out the damage and debris, only after we’ve learned what it means to love ourselves."
"You love in others what you love in yourself. You hate in others what you cannot see in yourself."
"Emotional freedom and inner peace come from knowing what to do when those negative thoughts and feelings arise, because they will."
"Whenever there is a problem in your life, there is a problem with how you are thinking, reacting, or responding. Whatever you feel you are not receiving is a direct reflection of what you are not giving. Whatever you are angered by is what you aren’t willing to see in yourself."
"It is in this we realize that love is sharing what we already have, not relying on someone else to give us something to supplement."
"Suffering is a resistance to pain, and it’s in resistance that we suffer."
"You must learn to let your conscious decisions dictate your day—not your fears or impulses"
"The issues we take are reflections of what’s wrong with us, the people we hate reflections of our insecurities. No matter how many things come and go, we take the same issues and hate the same people for the same reasons, and never stop to realize that it’s not them that we hate; it’s the parts of us they force us to recognize."
"The purpose of most great love is to gut you open, teach you what you need to know, and send you on your way to bigger, better, even happier things. Don’t let your irrational fears talk you out of letting yourself find that."
"The people who have been through a lot are often the ones who are wiser and kinder and happier overall. This is because they’ve been “through” it, not “past” it or “over” it. They’ve completely acknowledged their feelings and they’ve learned and they’ve grown. They develop compassion and self-awareness."
"Nobody cares about your social media presence as much as you do."
"Socially intelligent people listen to criticism before they respond to it—an immediate emotional response without thoughtful consideration is just defensiveness."
"The next time you feel like you’re in an inescapable circumstance, honestly scan your body and see what’s present. Even a tightness or uneasy feeling in your gut is just that—a little bit of stress. That’s it. That is all. That is all that feeling can do to you. Check back in after an hour, after a day…it will probably be gone."
"How other people want to perceive you is their problem, which they will have to come to terms with eventually. How much you want to allow their perceptions to affect you is yours."
"We say we want unconditional love and happiness, but we don’t behave as though we do. We want love and happiness when we get someone or something. Why? Because it puts the responsibility of choosing happiness, working on it, and toward it on something else."
"A friend once told me that the secret to finding love was not to actually look for it, but to heal the things that were preventing you from seeing and receiving it."
"Your life turns into a series of little love stories, all of which teach you how to love better, how to give more, how to be more of yourself, what you like and what you don’t. How to walk away with grace, and respect yourself genuinely, and listen to your intuition."
"Fear means you’re trying to move toward something you love, but your old beliefs, or unhealed experiences, are getting in the way."
"Learning to craft routine is the equivalent of learning to let your conscious choices about what your day will be about guide you, letting all the other, temporary crap fall to the wayside."
"If you think love is something that exists anywhere but within your own mind and heart, you will never have it"
"The amount of life we waste gathering and holding onto the things that will never really serve us does one thing and one thing only: keeps us away from the things that matter, that bring us joy and purpose and meaning, for that much longer."
"It’s uncomfortable to work, to stretch the capacity of your tolerance, to be vulnerable with someone you care deeply about, but it is never more comfortable than going your whole life without the things you really want."
"They never overgeneralize other people through their behaviors."
"They don’t use “you always” or “you never” to illustrate a point. Likewise, they root their arguments in statements that begin with “I feel” as opposed to “you are.” They do this because choosing language that feels unthreatening to someone is the best way to get them to open up to your perspective and actually create the dialogue that will lead to the change you desire."
"It showed you what you do deserve. Those relationships didn’t actually hurt you; they showed you an unhealed part of yourself, a part that was preventing you from being truly loved. That’s what happens when we finally get past hurtful experiences and terrible relationships: We realize we are worth more, and so we choose more. We realize how we blindly or naively said “yes” to someone or gave them our mind and heart space when we didn’t have to. We realize our role in choosing what we want in our lives, and by experiencing what seems like the worst, we finally acknowledge that it feels so wrong because we deserve so much more."
"Self-responsibility."
"You hold yourself accountable for your own happiness. You understand the phrase “it may not be your fault, but it is still your problem.” You are in control of your life because you are not letting other things do it for you."
"You cannot squeeze someone into your brokenness and expect that to make you whole."
"Feeling like the dreams you had for your life are collapsing."
"What you do not realize at this moment is that it is making way for a reality better than you could have thought of, one that’s more aligned with who you are, not who you thought you would be."
"Most things aren’t as hard or as trying as we chalk them up to be. They’re ultimately fun and rewarding and expressions of who we really are. That’s why we want them. Taking small steps will remind you that this is true. It will soothe you in a way that just thinking about taking action never will. It’s easier to act your way into a new way of thinking rather than think your way into a new way of acting, so do one little thing today and let the momentum build."
"The ultimate path to happiness is non-attachment."
"The sooner you face you, the sooner other people’s actions don’t affect you negatively—your mindset doesn’t depend on them. You don’t depend on them. Relationships do not serve to give you eternal, perpetual happiness. They serve to make you more aware. The sooner you realize that said awareness is your own, the easier everything else is."
"Self-assertiveness."
"You can stand up for yourself without being defensive. Defensiveness is born of fear; assertiveness is born of confidence."
"This is one of the simplest changes in perception, and yet also something truly fulfilled people master: the knowing that everything is an opportunity to experience. You don’t have to go to work; you get to go to work. You don’t have to wake up early; you get to wake up early. When you start considering things not as obligations but as opportunities, you start taking advantage of them rather than trying to avoid them."
"They speak with precision."
"They say what they intend to say without skirting around the issue. They speak calmly, simply, concisely, and mindfully"
"If your life is missing something you cannot place back into it, restructure. You will get nowhere dismantling the pieces with nothing to take their place. You’ll end up reassembling the parts of the old life you are trying to do away with. Step away and build anew. Anything new. You cannot expect to carry on with the same life you had without someone and not have that gaping hole torture you."
"We are all just waiting for another universe to collide with ours"
"The ways in which your current situation—though perhaps unplanned or unwanted—could be the path to the place you’ve actually always wanted to be, if only you’d begin to think of it that way."
"It’s interesting how we realize the storm returns to calm, but we see the stars differently now, and we don’t know, and we can’t choose, whose wreckage can do that for us."
"A good life comes from choosing to work with what you have, accepting that you don’t always choose what you work with, but knowing you’re always given what you need to use, especially when you don’t realize you need to use it."
"They don’t withhold their feelings or try to temper them so much as to render them almost gone. They do, however, have the capacity to withhold their emotional response until they are in an environment wherein it would be appropriate to express how they are feeling. They don’t suppress it; they manage it effectively."
"And your arrival at the conclusion that you cannot go on like this, that you’re missing out, that you’re off-track and feeling stuck and lost, is you realizing that you need not change your feelings. You just have to learn to lean into them and see what they are trying to tell you."
"We all start as strangers, but we forget that we rarely choose who ends up a stranger, too."
"There is no such thing as letting go; there’s just accepting what’s already gone"
"If you want to be understood, explain. There is nothing we need more than people who are willing to kindly, gently, wholly, patiently explain to others."
"The difference between the kind of people who turn their obstacles into opportunities and the kind of people who are crushed beneath the weight of their own uncertainty is knowledge and awareness."
"You can control how you treat people, but you cannot actually control what they think. The idea that behaving a certain way will elicit a certain response is a delusion that will keep you puppeteering through your life. It will distance you from the person you want to be and the life you want to live. And for what? People are going to judge, criticize, condemn, love, admire, envy, and lust based on their own subjective perceptions regardless."
"You’re working toward a goal. Even if you’re exhausted and it feels miles away, you have a dream for yourself, however vague and malleable."
"You feel content because routine consistently reaffirms a decision you already made."
"You’re supposed to be embarrassed of your younger self—really."
"gs immediately in the morning."
"It’s a mark of progress. (It doesn’t mean you have to stay embarrassed, though.) It’s good because it means you’re able to look back and wonder, “How was I ever at that place?” indicating that you’re no longer there. I hope you never reach a point in which you look back on your younger self and think, “Wow, I had it all figured out!” That means you stopped growing. (And that means you stopped living.)"
"Choose change. Your routine, your job, your city, your habits, your mindset. Never sit and fester in frustration. It does not matter whether or not you’re in the absolute worst-case scenario, complaining, worrying or being negative will never help. Anything. At all. Ever."
"The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
"To validate someone else’s feelings is to accept that they feel the way they do without trying to use logic to dismiss or deny or change their minds"
"Realizing you are the only person responsible for your life and your happiness."
"worthy of something is just to be grateful to have it. You choose what your self-esteem is measured by. You decide what your worth is based on. You decide whether or not you’re good enough for something, and because that is the case, you decide that the people who are worthy of what they have are the ones who are grateful to have it. Nothing more, nothing less."
"Changing how other people think and treat you is not a matter of how outraged you get, but how willing you are to explain, teach, and share. Defensiveness never precedes growth, it stunts it."
"You either let yourself feel everything or numb yourself into feeling nothing. You cannot select emotions. You are either in accord with their flow or in resistance to their nature. In the end, the choice is yours."
"Write down what you hate about other people. This is what you need to change about yourself/your life"
"You probably can’t be whatever you want, but if you’re really lucky and you work really hard, you can be exactly who you are."
"Being truly at peace requires realizing that everything is for the best. Everything in your life does one of three things: shows you to yourself, heals a part of yourself, or lets you enjoy a part of yourself. If you adopt that perspective, there’s nothing left to fear."
"If you wait on the feeling of “readiness,” you’ll be waiting forever, and worse, you’ll miss the best of what’s in front of you."
"Your story doesn’t have to flow. You don’t have to be neatly packaged in a way that other people understand."
"I don’t think there are people crueler to one another more than people who really, really love each other."
"Nobody is thinking about you as much as you are thinking about you."
"The fact that it is hard to do everything: It’s hard to be in a relationship, it’s hard not to be in one. It’s hard to have to perform at a job you love and are emotionally invested in, it’s hard not to be living your dreams by a certain age. Everything is hard; it’s just a matter of what you think is worth the effort."
"The love you really want is your own. What you’re seeking in someone else is what you aren’t giving to yourself."
"Everybody else is running around worrying about themselves as much as you are worrying about yourself."
"There’s too much at stake…"
"…to waste your time on worrying about things that are impermanent, unimportant, and ultimately just distractions from the things that bring you joy."
"The main thing socially intelligent people understand is that your relationship to everyone else is an extension of your relationship to yourself."
"Your feelings of panic are directly related to wanting to change yourself to fit someone else’s idea of who you are."
"Sometimes, the best way to get over anything is just to work on forgetting about it. Not everything requires analysis."
"What “enough” means to you. What’s enough money, enough love, enough productivity. Fulfillment is a product of knowing what “enough” is—otherwise you will be constantly seeking more."
"The best way to forget is to fill your life with new, better things. Things you may not have expected, things you didn’t know you didn’t know about, things you never imagined you’d like."
"Have faith that you’ll get more than you think you deserve."
"You have to become the kind of person who deserves the life you want. Nobody ever got what they wanted by wanting it badly enough. Your life will unfold in direct proportion to how much you believe you deserve. Not how much you think you should have. How much you believe you deserve."
"Meditate and imagine speaking with your oldest, wisest, most optimal future self. What you’re doing is tapping deep into your subconscious. Let your choices be guided by the person you hope to become."
"Work on developing your mental strength. Train your mind like you would your body. Work on focusing, thinking, imagining. This is the single best thing you can possibly do for your life."
"Keep your spaces clean and clear."
"Recite mantras or prayers or motivational speeches in the mirror, if you must. Anything that focuses your mind on something positive and hopeful."
"Trust that things get better as time goes on. Not because time heals, but because you grow. You discover that you’re capable. You realize that your fourth breakup doesn’t hurt even nearly as bad as your first did. This isn’t because life is easier, it’s because you’re smarter."
