“But now I realize that the only way to find your voice is to use it. It’s hardwired built into you. Talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.”
“We all love things that other people think are garbage. You have to have the courage to keep loving your garbage because what makes us unique is the diversity and breadth of our influences the unique ways in which we mix up the parts of culture others have deemed “high” and the “low.” When you find things you genuinely enjoy don’t let anyone else make you feel bad about it. Don’t feel guilty about the pleasure you take in the things you enjoy. Celebrate them.”
“Become a documentarian of what you do.”
"Remembering that I’ll be dead soon is the most important tool I’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. Because almost everything—all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure—these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked.” —Steve Jobs"
